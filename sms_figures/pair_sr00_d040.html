In many video-on-demand and music streaming services the user is provided with a homepage containing several recommendation lists, i.e., carousels, each built with a certain criteria (e.g., artist, mood, Action movies etc.).

We focus in particular on the adiabatic computing paradigm and use the D-Wave quantum annealer, which is able to solve NP-hard optimization problems, can be programmed by classical operations research tools and is freely available on the cloud.

In the present study, we formulate an Ising model to control a large number of automated guided vehicles in a factory without collision.

In this work we investigate the solvability of this problem with a D-Wave quantum annealer. These machines are optimizers for quadratic unconstrained optimization problems (QUBO). Therefore the flight gate assignment problem seems to be well suited for these machines. We use real world data from a mid-sized German airport as well as simulation based data to extract typical instances small enough to be amenable to the D-Wave machine. In order to mitigate precision problems, we employ bin packing on the passenger numbers to reduce the precision requirements of the extracted instances. We find that, for the instances we investigated, the bin packing has little effect on the solution quality.

The representation allows a natural decomposition of a real-world instance related to wind-optimal trajectories over the Atlantic Ocean into smaller subproblems that can be discretized and are amenable to be programmed in quantum annealers.

NSP seeks the optimal assignment for a set of nurses to shifts under an accompanying set of constraints on schedule and personnel. After reducing NSP to a novel Ising-type Hamiltonian, we evaluate the solution quality obtained from the D-Wave 2000Q against the constraint requirements as well as the diversity of solutions. For the test problems explored here, our results indicate that quantum annealing recovers satisfying solutions for NSP and suggests the heuristic method is potentially achievable for practical use. Moreover, we observe that solution quality can be greatly improved through the use of reverse annealing, in which it is possible to refine returned results by using the annealing process a second time.

Key economic decisions are taken about the location, number, and size of manufacturing facilities and warehouses based on the optimal solution. Therefore, improvements in the methods to address this question, which is known to be in the NP-hard complexity class, would have relevant financial consequences. Here, we implement in the D-Wave quantum annealer a hybrid classical-quantum annealing algorithm. The cost function with constraints is translated to a spin Hamiltonian, whose ground state encodes the searched result.

This paper proposes a hybrid QC-based deep learning framework for fault diagnosis of electrical power systems that combine the feature extraction capabilities of conditional restricted Boltzmann machine with an efficient classification of deep networks. Computational challenges stemming from the complexities of such deep learning models are overcome by QC-based training methodologies that effectively leverage the complementary strengths of quantum assisted learning and classical training techniques. The proposed hybrid QC-based deep learning framework is tested on a simulated electrical power system with 30 buses and wide variations of substation and transmission line faults, to demonstrate the framework\u2019s applicability, efficiency, and generalization capabilities. High computational efficiency is enjoyed by the proposed hybrid approach in terms of computational effort required and quality of diagnosis performance over classical training methods. In addition, superior and reliable fault diagnosis performance with faster response time is achieved over state-of-the-art pattern recognition methods based on artificial neural networks (ANN) and decision trees (DT).","2021","5/11/2022 15:39","5/15/2022 17:13",null,"117628",null,null,"303",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\D8K5CDWH\\Ajagekar and You - 2021 - Quantum computing based hybrid deep learning for f.pdf",null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","NO","NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.555555556,0.8,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",3.062,null,"Manufacturing","Repair and installation of machinery and equipment","Repair of fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment","Repair of electrical equipment"],["I4392TBW","conferencePaper",2021,"Kuroda, T.; Kuwahara, T.; Yonaga, K.; Osaki, T.; Miyama, M.J.; Ohzeki, M.","Quantum annealing for ICT system design automation",null,695.0,null,null,null,"10.1109/CCGrid51090.2021.00025","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114897752&doi=10.1109%2fCCGrid51090.2021.00025&partnerID=40&md5=592ca6b65adab19df6e16a83ed8ee323","Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Conference","J","62","620","6202",null,"2021","5/11/2022 16:35","5/15/2022 15:32",null,"156-165",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Scopus",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"included",null,null,"Proceedings - 21st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing, CCGrid 2021","YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.555555556,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"A","Information and communication","Computer programming, consultancy and related activities","Computer programming, consultancy and related activities","Computer consultancy and computer facilities management activities"],["GHUSTHSC","bookSection",2020,"Chiscop, Irina; Nauta, Jelle; Veerman, Bert; Phillipson, Frank","A Hybrid Solution Method for the Multi-Service Location Set Covering Problem",null,952.0,"Computational Science \u2013 ICCS 2020",null,null,"10.1007/978-3-030-50433-5_41","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128623258","Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Conference","O","84","841","8413","Abstract The Multi-Service Location Set Covering Problem is an extension of the well-known Set Covering Problem. It arises in practical applications where a set of physical locations need to be equipped with services to satisfy demand within a certain area, while minimizing costs. In this paper we formulate the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, apply the hybrid framework of the D-Wave quantum annealer to solve it, and investigate the feasibility of this approach. To improve the often suboptimal initial solutions found on the D-Wave system, we develop a hybrid quantum/classical optimization algorithm that starts from the seed solution and iteratively creates small subproblems that are more efficiently solved on the D-Wave but often still converge to feasible and improved solutions of the original problem. Finally we suggest some opportunities for increasing the accuracy and performance of our algorithm.","2020","5/11/2022 15:39","5/16/2022 14:41",null,"531-545",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-50433-5_41",null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.666666667,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"A","Public administration and defence;
