In reality, demand of a certain product becomes highly effected by on-hand stock level in stores and the selling price of the product. In the proposed model, demand of the product is dependent on these two vital deceive factors. In real life production systems, always there are some defective products which requires reworking in order to make them useful. The possibility of producing some defective items in regular production process and their reworking has been taken into account in the model. In case of inventories of highly demandable products, it is observed that production rate is proportional to demand. The situation also arises in case of launching a new product or in a multi-stage production system. In this model, production rate is a variable and it varies with the demand rate. Shortages are allowed and it is backlogged fully. Based on these assumptions, several researchers worked on but they considered that the associated inventory cost parameters are fixed real numbers. However, these are not fixed in reality and may vary time to time depending upon some scenario. Main objective of the paper is to develop a production inventory model under those assumptions considering various cost parameters as interval numbers. As a result the corresponding optimization problem is also interval valued. Quantum behaved particle swarm optimization technique has been applied to find the maximum profit in a single cycle. Numerical example and sensitivity analysis are given to illustrate the proposed inventory model.  2019, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.","2020","4/11/2022 15:14","5/4/2022 11:23",null,"385-399",null,"2","11",null,"International Journal of Systems Assurance Engineering and Management",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Publisher: Springer",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\TY5WT3EX\\Ruidas et al. - 2020 - An EPQ model with stock and selling price dependen.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13198-019-00867-w","Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Numerical methods; Sensitivity analysis; Inventory control; Defects; included; reverse snowball; forward snowball",null,null,null,"NO",null,"NO","YES",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.25,0.857142857,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q3",0.3,null,"Manufacturing","Manufacture of leather and related products","Tanning and dressing of leather; manufacture of luggage, handbags, saddlery and harness; dressing and dyeing of fur","Manufacture of luggage, handbags and the like, saddlery and harness"],["S7PQWZ65","conferencePaper",2018,"Zhang, Y.; Lyden, S.; De La Barra, B.A.L.; Haque, M.E.","Optimization of Tremblay's battery model parameters for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle applications",null,null,null,null,null,"10.1109/AUPEC.2017.8282405","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050917674&doi=10.1109%2fAUPEC.2017.8282405&partnerID=40&md5=b21f7e69bb78699deeb9f376bdd9e4f5","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Conference","C","27","272","2720",null,"2018","4/11/2022 15:15","5/11/2022 16:18",null,"1-6",null,null,"2017-November",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Scopus",null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\AGZQ94JW\\Zhang et al. - 2018 - Optimization of Tremblay's battery model parameter.pdf",null,"included; reverse snowball; forward snowball",null,null,"2017 Australasian Universities Power Engineering Conference, AUPEC 2017","YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.75,0.6,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"Not assigned","Manufacturing","Manufacture of electrical equipment","Manufacture of batteries and accumulators","Manufacture of batteries and accumulators"],["ITNK88F2","conferencePaper",2020,"Sheng, Jiangfan; Kong, Weijian; Qi, Jie","Process optimization of carbon fiber precursor spinning coagulation process based on surrogate model",null,null,"2020 Chinese Automation Congress (CAC)",null,null,"10.1109/CAC51589.2020.9326779",null,"Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Conference","C","23","239","2399","High-quality carbon fiber precursor is the key to the manufacture of high-performance carbon fiber, and the coagulation process is one of the key steps in the preparation of the precursor. This coagulation process is an industrial process with complex mechanism and strict control accuracy requirements. Therefore, iterative optimization based on its strict mechanism model will be much time-consuming. In order to reduce the computational cost, a process optimization method for the coagulation process of carbon liber precursor spinning based on surrogate model was proposed. Using meta-modeling technology, this paper constructs the surrogate model which describes the relationship between the key operating parameters and the main output variables in the coagulation process. In the process of constructing the surrogate model, an evolutionary optimal sample point insertion criterion is adopted to improve the accuracy of the model. And the quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is applied for searching operating parameters in the design space. The simulation results show that the proposed method not only provides a group of satisfactory operating parameters, but also greatly reduces the calculation cost.","2020-11","4/11/2022 15:14","5/12/2022 15:41",null,"6816-6821",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"ISSN: 2688-0938",null,"; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\KN7RFETR\\9326779.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\5S56PYE9\\9326779.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\UESCYFJ7\\Sheng et al. - 2020 - Process optimization of carbon fiber precursor spi.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CAC51589.2020.9326779","included; reverse snowball; forward snowball","Coagulation; Carbon; Mathematical model; Computational modeling; Particle swarm optimization; Process control; carbon fiber precursor; coagulation process; evolutionary optimal sample point insertion criterion; quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization; Spinning; surrogate model",null,"2020 Chinese Automation Congress (CAC)","YES","NO","YES",null,null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.5,0.466666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"Not assigned","Manufacturing","Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products","Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c.","Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products n.e.c."],["C8WRRZKP","journalArticle",2014,"Gholizadeh, Saeed; Moghadas, Reza Kamyab","Performance-Based Optimum Design of Steel Frames by an Improved Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",14469.0,null,"Advances in Structural Engineering",null,"1369-4332","10.1260/1369-4332.17.2.143","https://doi.org/10.1260/1369-4332.17.2.143","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","C","24","243","2431","The main aim of this work is to present a methodology for performance-based optimum seismic design of moment resisting steel frame structures.

Here, CEED is represented using cubic criterion function to reduce the nonlinearities of the system. Along with economic load dispatch, emissions of SO2, NOx, and CO2 are considered as separate three objectives, thus making it a four-objective (many-objective) optimization problem. A unit-wise price penalty factor is considered here to convert all the objectives into a single objective in order to compare the final results with other previously used methods like Lagrangian relaxation (LR), particle swarm optimization, and simulated annealing. QBA is applied in six-unit power generation system for four different loads. The obtained results show QBA successfully solve many-objective CEED problem with greater superiority than other methods found in the literature in terms of quality results, robustness, and computational performance. In the end of this paper, a detailed future research direction is provided based on the simulation results and its analysis. The outcome of this research demonstrates that the inclusion of quantum computing idea in metaheuristic technique provides a useful and reliable tool for solving such many-objective optimization problem.","2019-10","4/11/2022 15:14","5/11/2022 16:34",null,"5857-69",null,"10","31",null,"Neural Computing and Applications",null,"Neural Comput.

The DEMD method is employed to decompose the electric load to several detail parts associated with high frequencies (intrinsic mode function-IMF) and an approximate part associated with low frequencies. Hybridized with quantum theory to enhance particle searching performance, the so-called QPSO is used to optimize the parameters of SVR. The electric load data of the New South Wales (Sydney, Australia) market and the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO, New York, USA) are used for comparing the forecasting performances of different forecasting models.

Thus, in order to efficiently resolve this problem, the multi-objective quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (MOQPSO) is presented in this paper. In MOQPSO, the elite archive set is adopted to conserve Pareto optimal solutions and provide multiple evolutionary directions for individuals, while the neighborhood searching and chaotic mutation strategies are used to enhance the search capability and diversity of population. Furthermore, a novel constraint handling method is designed to adjust the constraint violation of hydro and thermal plants, respectively.

Mathematically, the ecological operation of cascade hydropower reservoirs is a high-dimensional, nonlinear and strong spatiotemporal coupling constrained optimization problem. To overcome the premature convergence and stagnation search of traditional methods in resolving this problem, this paper develops a novel algorithm known as simplex quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization, where the probabilistic mutation operator is performed on historical best position of some individuals, and then the simplex neighborhood search strategy based on the dynamic probability identification is used to enhance the local exploration ability of the swarm.

In order to solve the problem of environmental economic dispatch (EED), this paper proposes a DE-CQPSO (Differential Evolution-Crossover Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization) algorithm based on the fast convergence of differential evolution algorithms and the particle diversity of crossover operators of genetic algorithms. In order to obtain better optimization results, a parameter adaptive control method is used to update the crossover probability. And the problem of multi-objective optimization is solved by introducing a penalty factor. The experimental results show that: the evaluation index and convergence speed of the DE-CQPSO algorithm are better than QPSO (Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization) and other algorithms, whether it is single-objective optimization of fuel cost and emissions or multi-objective optimization considering both optimization objectives. A good compromise value is verified, which verifies the effectiveness and robustness of the DE-CQPSO algorithm in solving environmental economic dispatch problems. The study provides a new research direction for solving environmental economic dispatch problems. At the same time, it provides a reference for the reasonable output of the unit to a certain extent.","2020-08-15","4/27/2022 16:02","5/12/2022 15:37","4/27/2022 16:02","113370",null,null,"152",null,"Expert Systems with Applications",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"en",null,null,null,null,"ScienceDirect",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\XVM6QIPE\\Xin-gang et al. - 2020 - An improved quantum particle swarm optimization al.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball","Quantum particle swarm optimization; Crossover operator; Adaptive control; Carbon emission reduction; Differential evolution operator; Environmental economic dispatch",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.666666667,0.6,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",1.368,null,"Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution"],["6GUUCY87","journalArticle",2018,"Mahdi, Fahad Parvez; Vasant, Pandian; Abdullah-Al-Wadud, Mohammad; Watada, Junzo; Kallimani, Vish","A quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization approach for environmental/economic power dispatch problem using cubic criterion function",21100241220.0,null,"International Transactions on Electrical Energy Systems",null,"2050-7038","10.1002/etep.2497","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/etep.2497","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","D","35","351","3510","In electrical power dispatch problem, economic dispatch (ED) and environmental dispatch problems play a crucial part. Economic dispatch problem refers to the minimization of generation cost, where environmental dispatch problem refers to the minimization of emission of pollutants like CO2, SO2, and NOx from the power generation system. A quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization (QPSO) technique is presented in this paper to solve many-objective environmental economic dispatch (EED) problems. Emissions of CO2, SO2, and NOx are considered 3 different objectives, thus making it a 4-objective problem considering ED. Many-objective EED problems are defined by using a cubic criterion function, and a max/max price penalty factor is considered to convert all the objectives into a single objective to compare the final results with other well-known methods found in the literature like Lagrangian relaxation, particle swarm optimization, simulated annealing, and quantum-behaved bat algorithm. Quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization is implemented on a 6-unit system to solve many-objective EED problems, and at the same time, to show the effectiveness of QPSO in large systems, it is also implemented in a 26-unit power generation system for ED problem. The obtained results demonstrate and verify the effectiveness and robustness of QPSO to solve many-objective EED problems. This also shows that QPSO can effectively be implemented in such power dispatch problems.","2018","4/27/2022 16:24","5/11/2022 15:55","4/27/2022 16:24","e2497",null,"3","28",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"en",null,null,null,null,"Wiley Online Library",null,"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/etep.2497",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\RKHCJZ95\\Mahdi et al. - 2018 - A quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization app.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball","quantum particle swarm optimization; economic load dispatch; cubic criterion function; emission reduction; environmental economic dispatch; many-objective optimization; max/max penalty factor",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.666666667,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q2",0.453,null,"Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution"],["F3TGSW3M","journalArticle",2014,"Hosseinnezhad, Vahid; Rafiee, Mansour; Ahmadian, Mohammad; Ameli, Mohammad Taghi","Species-based Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization for economic load dispatch",17985.0,null,"International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems",null,"0142-0615","10.1016/j.ijepes.2014.05.066","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142061514003378","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","D","35","351","3510","Economic load dispatch (ELD) is one of the important optimization problems in the operation of power systems which can be helpful to create effective generating management plans.

The bat algorithm (BA) is an acknowledged metaheuristic optimization algorithm owing to its performance. However, the classical BA presents some weaknesses, such as premature convergence. To withstand the drawbacks of the BA, quantum mechanics theories and Gaussian and Cauchy operators are integrated into the standard BA to enhance its effectiveness. Since the economic load dispatch is a nonlinear, complex and constrained optimization problem, its main objective is to reduce the total generation cost while matching the equality and inequality constraints of the system. The validity of the CGQBA is tested on six standard benchmark functions with different characteristics. The numerical results indicate that the CGQBA is effective and superior to many other algorithms. Moreover, the CGQBA is applied to solve the ELD problems on various test systems including 3,6,20, 40,110 and 160 implemented generating units. The simulation results illustrate the strength of the CGQBA compared with other algorithms recently reported in the literature.","2021","5/11/2022 14:23","5/13/2022 22:09",null,"3207-3228",null,null,"9",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.777777778,0.733333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",0.927,null,"Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution"],["VHV33V7W","journalArticle",2019,"Zhang, Z.;

A novel hybrid multi-step-ahead forecast model is introduced to solve this problem. Partial autocorrelation function (PACF) is first used to analyze the characteristics of the target time series for extracting the appropriate input variables. Least-square support vector machine (LSSVM) with recursive mechanism is then explored for modelling multi-step-ahead forecasts, in which the forecast model is adjusted adaptively as long as new information is updated. The parameters in LSSVM are optimized based on an improved quantum-inspired version of Grey Wolf Optimizer (QGWO). The QGWO fortifies against the stagnation of the wolves at an optimal local point using three strategies including the quantum operator, non-linear convergence factor, and dynamic weighting. In this paper, the performance of QGWO was first demonstrated with that of other meta-heuristic (MH) algorithms in solving eight mathematical benchmark problems. Two time series of reservoir water availability in Zhoushan Islands, China, were then provided and analyzed to validate the performance of the advanced forecast approach in multi-step-ahead forecasts. The forecasts were compared with those obtained by the non-adaptive (NA) and non-recursive (NR) models. Results indicate that (1) QGWO displays superior performance on model parameters optimization than other comparative MH algorithms; (2) The proposed hybrid model in consideration of the nearest anterior feedback, as well as the adaptive mechanism, not only outperforms the two comparative models (NA, NR) but significantly enhances the accuracy of multi-step-ahead forecasts for non-stationary time series and low or high volume events, even as the forecast time horizon increases.","2021","5/3/2022 16:13","5/15/2022 16:40",null,"125769",null,null,"597",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\IUR5G3PH\\Guo et al. - 2021 - Multi-step-ahead forecast of reservoir water avail.pdf",null,"included","Adaptive and recursive mechanism; Island areas; Multi-step-ahead forecast; Quantum Grey Wolf Optimizer (QGWO); Reservoir water availability",null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.75,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",1.611,null,"Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities","Water collection, treatment and supply","Water collection, treatment and supply","Water collection, treatment and supply"],["B8A3QEUS","journalArticle",2020,"Feng, Z.-K.; Niu, W.-J.; Tang, Z.-Y.; Jiang, Z.-Q.; Xu, Y.; Liu, Y.; Zhang, H.-R.","Monthly runoff time series prediction by variational mode decomposition and support vector machine based on quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization",50089.0,null,"Journal of Hydrology",null,null,"10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124627","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078757694&doi=10.1016%2fj.jhydrol.2020.124627&partnerID=40&md5=c338003c62335fe67f04f7eb489751b1","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","E","36","360","3600",null,"2020","5/4/2022 11:38","5/16/2022 14:36",null,null,null,null,"583",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Scopus",null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\VYQP9NBE\\Feng et al. - 2020 - Monthly runoff time series prediction by variation.pdf",null,"included","Decomposition and ensemble; Machine learning technique; Monthly runoff prediction; Swarm intelligence method; Three Gorges and Danjiangkou Reservoirs",null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.75,0.733333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",1.684,null,"Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities","Water collection, treatment and supply","Water collection, treatment and supply","Water collection, treatment and supply"],["MXVUMVPM","conferencePaper",2021,"Henderson, Jessie M.; O\u2019Malley, Daniel; Viswanathan, Hari S.","Interrogating the performance of quantum annealing for the solution of steady-state subsurface flow",null,null,"2021 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)",null,null,"10.1109/HPEC49654.2021.9622819",null,"Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Conference","E","36","360","3600","In the 1990s, the principles of quantum mechanics were leveraged to describe how discrete combinatorial optimization problems could be solved using a method called quantum annealing.

Among others, an important goal is the minimization of the total transit time of the passengers. The corresponding objective function is quadratic in the binary decision variables encoding the flight-to-gate assignment. Hence, it is a quadratic assignment problem being hard to solve in general. In this work we investigate the solvability of this problem with a D-Wave quantum annealer. These machines are optimizers for quadratic unconstrained optimization problems (QUBO). Therefore the flight gate assignment problem seems to be well suited for these machines. We use real world data from a mid-sized German airport as well as simulation based data to extract typical instances small enough to be amenable to the D-Wave machine. In order to mitigate precision problems, we employ bin packing on the passenger numbers to reduce the precision requirements of the extracted instances. We find that, for the instances we investigated, the bin packing has little effect on the solution quality. Hence, we were able to solve small problem instances extracted from real data with the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer.","2019","4/25/2022 14:01","5/13/2022 22:04",null,"99-110",null,null,null,null,null,null,"Lecture Notes in Computer Science",null,null,null,"Springer International Publishing","Cham","en",null,null,null,null,"Springer Link",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\2MYGAWJY\\Stollenwerk et al. - 2019 - Flight Gate Assignment with a Quantum Annealer.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball","Quantum annealing; Airport planning; Quadratic assignment problem; QUBO","Feld, Sebastian; Linnhoff-Popien, Claudia",null,"NO",null,"YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES",null,"NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.571428571,0.642857143,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Service activities incidental to air transportation"],["VC9K5BV6","journalArticle",2020,"Stollenwerk, Tobias; O\u2019Gorman, Bryan; Venturelli, Davide; Mandr\u00e0, Salvatore; Rodionova, Olga; Ng, Hokkwan; Sridhar, Banavar; Rieffel, Eleanor Gilbert; Biswas, Rupak","Quantum Annealing Applied to De-Conflicting Optimal Trajectories for Air Traffic Management",18378.0,null,"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems",null,"1558-0016","10.1109/TITS.2019.2891235",null,"Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Journal","H","52","522","5223","We present the mapping of a class of simplified air traffic management problems (strategic conflict resolution) to quadratic unconstrained Boolean optimization problems.

The representation allows a natural decomposition of a real-world instance related to wind-optimal trajectories over the Atlantic Ocean into smaller subproblems that can be discretized and are amenable to be programmed in quantum annealers. In this paper, we tested the new programming techniques, and we benchmark the hardness of the instances using both classical solvers and the D-Wave 2X and D-Wave 2000Q quantum chip.

In Asia, the traffic situation can be further deteriorated by road sharing of scooters. How to control the traffic flow to mitigate the congestion has been one of the central issues in transportation research. In this study, we employ a quantum annealing approach to optimize the traffic signals control at a real-life intersection with mixed traffic flows of vehicles and scooters. Considering traffic flow is a continuous and emerging phenomenon, we used quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formalism for traffic optimization, which has a natural equivalence to the Ising model and can be solved efficiently on the quantum annealers, quantum computers or digital annealers. In this article, we first applied the QUBO traffic optimization to artificially generated traffic for a simple intersection, and then we used real-time traffic data to simulate a real \"Dongda-Keyuan\" intersection with dedicated cars and scooter lanes, as well as mixed scooter and car lanes. We introduced two types of traffic light control systems for traffic optimization: C-QUBO and QUBO. Our rigorous QUBO optimizations show that C-QUBO and QUBO outperform the commonly used fixed cycle method, with QUBO outperforming C-QUBO in some instances. It has been found that QUBO optimization significantly relieves traffic congestion for the unbalanced traffic volume. Furthermore, we found that dynamic changes in traffic light signal duration greatly reduce traffic congestion.","2021-11","5/3/2022 15:49","5/13/2022 22:06",null,"74-81",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"ISSN: 2693-8421",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\S84X95F3\\9704985.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\L2YQSACW\\9704985.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\3ZULA6CL\\Singh et al. - 2021 - Quantum Annealing Approach for the Optimal Real-ti.pdf",null,"included","Annealing; Quantum annealing; Urban areas; Motorcycles; Real-time systems; quantum computing; quantum annealing; Correlation; QUBO; real-time optimization; Roads; traffic optimization; traffic signal control",null,"2021 IEEE/ACIS 22nd International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD)","YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.75,0.8,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"C","Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Other transportation support activities"],["GPT28I5I","conferencePaper",2019,"James, Scott Howard; Raheb, Robert Nicholas","Path Planning for Critical ATM/UTM Areas",null,null,"2019 IEEE/AIAA 38th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)",null,null,"10.1109/DASC43569.2019.9081662",null,"Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization",null,null,"Conference","H","52","522","5223","We create a path planning algorithm to be used in areas where conventional aircraft and Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAV) are in close proximity.

To efficiently solve this model, an improved quantum evolutionary algorithm (QEA) based on the niche co-evolution strategy and enhanced particle swarm optimization (PSO), namely IPOQEA is designed. An IPOQEA-based gate allocation method is proposed to allocate the flights to suitable gates within different periods. Finally, the actual operation data of Baiyun Airport is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Comparison results show that the constructed model can address the passenger walking distances, robustness and costs in airport management.

The indirect optimization method, based on Pontryagin\u2019s maximum principle (PMP), is applied to optimize fuel consumption. To overcome the difficulty in nonsmooth integration caused by the bang-bang control, the homotopy method is adopted to solve the fuel-optimal problem from a related energy-optimal problem. The quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is used to obtain the energy-optimal solutions. The energy-optimal solutions are used as the initial values for the homotopic procedure to obtain the fuel-optimal solutions and optimal bang-bang control law. A hybrid algorithm combined homotopy method and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm is proposed. This hybrid algorithm can effectively obtain feasible optimal solutions even though the indirect optimization method exhibits a narrow convergence domain. Simulations of high-thrust and low-thrust rendezvous problems are provided and the proposed hybrid algorithm is verified. Moreover, the necessity of radial thrust is investigated.","2021","5/11/2022 16:09","5/13/2022 22:16",null,"012021",null,"1","2068",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\H3JADM5B\\Ren - 2021 - Optimization for Far-distance Cooperative Rendezvo.pdf",null,"included",null,null,null,"NO",null,"NO","YES",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.25,0.714285714,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Not assigned",0.21,null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Other transportation support activities"],["7JNJSF6F","journalArticle",2021,"Ding, Yongcheng; Chen, Xi; Lamata, Lucas; Solano, Enrique; Sanz, Mikel","Implementation of a Hybrid Classical-Quantum Annealing Algorithm for Logistic Network Design",null,null,"SN Computer Science",null,null,"10.1007/s42979-021-00466-2","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1135072547","Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Journal","H","52","522","5229","The logistic network design is an abstract optimization problem that, under the assumption of minimal cost, seeks the optimal configuration of the supply chain\u2019s infrastructures and facilities based on customer demand.

Therefore, improvements in the methods to address this question, which is known to be in the NP-hard complexity class, would have relevant financial consequences. Here, we implement in the D-Wave quantum annealer a hybrid classical-quantum annealing algorithm. The cost function with constraints is translated to a spin Hamiltonian, whose ground state encodes the searched result.

Given an initially clustered formation, a configuration, based on satellite coverage requirements, is set as the final configuration which the cluster aims to achieve, with minimal fuel consumption.

It was only recently that small but functional quantum computers have become available on the cloud, allowing to test their potential. In this paper we propose to leverage their capabilities to address an important task for recommender systems providers, the optimal selection of recommendation carousels. In many video-on-demand and music streaming services the user is provided with a homepage containing several recommendation lists, i.e., carousels, each built with a certain criteria (e.g., artist, mood, Action movies etc.). Choosing which set of carousels to display is a difficult problem because it needs to account for how the different recommendation lists interact, e.g., avoiding duplicate recommendations, and how they help the user explore the catalogue. We focus in particular on the adiabatic computing paradigm and use the D-Wave quantum annealer, which is able to solve NP-hard optimization problems, can be programmed by classical operations research tools and is freely available on the cloud. We propose a formulation of the carousel selection problem for black box recommenders, that can be solved effectively on a quantum annealer and has the advantage of being simple.

Most often software product developments are iterative and incremental in their nature, due to the changes in the customer requirements from time to time. It is a challenging task to select the requirements from a large number of candidates, for the accomplishment of the business goals. The problem is to identify a set of requirements to be included in the next release of the product, by minimizing the cost and maximizing the customer satisfaction. Since minimizing the total cost and maximizing the customer satisfaction are contradictory objectives, the problem has a multi-objective nature. This problem is NP-hard in its nature and so it cannot be solved efficiently by using traditional optimization techniques for large problem instances. QEMEA combines the best features of Evolutionary Algorithms and Quantum Computing. It employs the concepts of Quantum computing such as superposition and interference. The features of QEMEA help in achieving quality pareto-optimal front solutions and faster convergence while using a small population size. The performance of QEMEA is tested on six benchmark problems derived from the literature. The obtained results indicates consistent and superior performance of the algorithm.","2012-03","4/24/2022 22:18","5/4/2022 12:40",null,"782-787",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\KLUCFBGY\\6215945.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\VDFELL8Q\\Charan Kumari et al. - 2012 - Software requirements selection using Quantum-insp.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball","Benchmark testing; Multi-objective Next Release Problem; Quantum-inspired Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm; Search based software engineering; Software requirements selection",null,"IEEE-International Conference On Advances In Engineering, Science And Management (ICAESM -2012)","NO",null,"NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.375,0.714285714,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"Not assigned","Information and communication","Computer programming, consultancy and related activities","Computer programming, consultancy and related activities","Computer programming activities"],["I6836NX2","journalArticle",2011,"Sun, Jun; Fang, Wei; Wu, Xiaojun; Xie, Zhenping; Xu, Wenbo","QoS multicast routing using a quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm",24182.0,null,"Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence",null,"0952-1976","10.1016/j.engappai.2010.08.001","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197610001454","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","J","63","631","6311","QoS multicast routing in networks is a very important research issue in networks and distributed systems.

In the proposed method, QoS multicast routing is converted into an integer programming problem with QoS constraints and is solved by the QPSO algorithm combined with loop deletion operation. The QPSO-based routing method, along with the routing algorithms based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA), is tested on randomly generated network topologies for the purpose of performance evaluation. The simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed method on QoS the routing problem and its superiority to the methods based on PSO and GA.","2011-02-01","4/26/2022 13:58","5/4/2022 12:36","4/26/2022 13:58","123-131",null,"1","24",null,"Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"en",null,null,null,null,"ScienceDirect",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\CDZ7VJLA\\Sun et al. - 2011 - QoS multicast routing using a quantum-behaved part.pdf;

Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA), which originates from the organic integration of quantum computing and genetic algorithms, has the advantages of outstanding ability to seek optimal solutions, faster computing speed and smaller overall computing scale, and can solve multi-objective scheduling or optimization problems well. In this paper, the QGA's principle, method and basic flow is introduced, the constraints of the complex curriculum arrangement problem is discussed, and a method to solve the problem of course scheduling in colleges and universities by using this advanced algorithm is also given.

Now, one major drawback of the available models is that they consider the amount of carbon emission associated with various inventory processes like setup process, production process, inventory holding process, etc. as fixed numbers. However, these quantities may not be fixed in reality due to several factors, like the condition of the carbon filtrating apparatus in the production firm, machine breakdown, quality of the raw material, nature of the fuel or energy used, etc. The parameters may vary in between some certain ranges. This paper aims at developing an imperfect production inventory model under the various carbon emission regulatory policies where the various carbon emission parameters are interval numbers. The various inventory cost parameters are also represented as interval numbers to reflect the practical situation. The demand of the product is assumed to be a linearly decreasing function of the selling price of the product. Also, the idea of a new inventory cost component, referred to as the \u2018development cost\u2019 is introduced. Four different policies- simple tax policy, cap and purchase policy, cap and reward policy and strictly under permitted cap policy are discussed, and based on those policies four different inventory models are developed. The Quantum behaved Particle Swarm Optimization(QPSO) algorithm has been applied to find the optimal profit of the manufacturer. The optimal profit obtained here is also an interval number which is quite realistic. The traditional fuzzy or probabilistic approach to represent impreciseness fails to find such kind of solution. A numerical example for every case has been given to illustrate the applicability of the models. Finally, sensitivity analysis of the optimal feasible solution due to variation in some key parameters has been provided with the key managerial insights.","2021-04-01","5/4/2022 11:21","5/18/2022 11:46","5/4/2022 11:21","107154",null,null,"154",null,"Computers & Industrial Engineering",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"en",null,null,null,null,"ScienceDirect",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\ISRLT4XK\\Ruidas et al. - 2021 - A production inventory model with interval-valued .pdf",null,"included","Sustainable production;

The analyses suggest that the good solutions are clustered in the search space and there is a correlation between the \ufb01tness of a local optimum and its distance to the best solution. Inspired by these \ufb01ndings, a new operator for Quantum Evolutionary Algorithms is proposed which, during the search process, collects information about the \ufb01tness landscape and tried to capture the backbone structure of the landscape. The knowledge it has collected is used to guide the search process towards a better region in the search space. The proposed algorithm consists of two phases. The \ufb01rst phase uses a tabu mechanism to collect information about the \ufb01tness landscape. In the second phase, the collected data are processed to guide the algorithm towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm clusters the good solutions it has found in its previous search process. Then when the population is converged and trapped in a local optimum, it is divided into sub-populations and each sub-population is designated to a cluster. The information in the database is then used to reinitialize the q-individuals, so they represent better regions in the search space. This way the population maintains diversity and by capturing the \ufb01tness landscape structure, the algorithm is guided towards better regions in the search space.

The results show that the QPSO algorithm can traverse and search for a task allocation plan with shorter path and less energy consumption for multiple AUV systems under the same constraints, so that the task allocation can reach the global optimal.

The proposed method, denoted as DEQPSO, combines the DE algorithm with the QPSO algorithm in an attempt to further enhance the performance of both algorithms. The route planning for UAV on the sea is formulated as an optimization problem. A simple method of pretreatment to the terrain environment is proposed. A novel route planner for UAV is designed to generate a safe and flyable path in the presence of different threat environments based on the DEQPSO algorithm. To show the high performance of the proposed method, the DEQPSO algorithm is compared with the real-valued genetic algorithm, DE, standard particle swarm optimization (PSO), hybrid particle swarm with differential evolution operator, and QPSO in terms of the solution quality, robustness, and the convergence property. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of generating higher quality paths efficiently for UAV than any other tested optimization algorithms.","2013-11","4/24/2022 18:00","5/12/2022 16:05",null,"1451-1465",null,"6","43",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\TU2YN2ZA\\6525428.html;

It arises in practical applications where a set of physical locations need to be equipped with services to satisfy demand within a certain area, while minimizing costs. In this paper we formulate the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, apply the hybrid framework of the D-Wave quantum annealer to solve it, and investigate the feasibility of this approach. To improve the often suboptimal initial solutions found on the D-Wave system, we develop a hybrid quantum/classical optimization algorithm that starts from the seed solution and iteratively creates small subproblems that are more efficiently solved on the D-Wave but often still converge to feasible and improved solutions of the original problem. Finally we suggest some opportunities for increasing the accuracy and performance of our algorithm.","2020","5/11/2022 15:39","5/16/2022 14:41",null,"531-545",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-50433-5_41",null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.666666667,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"A","Public administration and defence; compulsory social security","Public administration and defence; compulsory social security","Administration of the State and the economic and social policy of the community","Regulation of and contribution to more efficient operation of businesses"]],"hovertemplate":"<b>S<sub>R</sub>: %{x}</b><br>S<sub>S</sub>: %{customdata[81]}<br>DOI: %{customdata[10]}<br>ISIC Section: %{customdata[96]}","marker":{"outliercolor":"black"},"meanline":{"color":"black","visible":true},"name":"O","points":"all","x":[0.733333333,0.666666667,0.5,0.6,0.666666667],"type":"violin"}],                        {"template":{"data":{"pie":[{"automargin":true,"type":"pie"}]},"layout":{"xaxis":{"showgrid":true,"title":{"standoff":15}},"yaxis":{"showgrid":true,"title":{"standoff":15}}}},"xaxis":{"range":[0,1],"title":{"text":"$S_R$"}},"yaxis":{"title":{"text":"ISIC Section"}},"showlegend":false},                        {"responsive": true}                    )                };                            </script>        </div>
