Inspired by strong non-linear learning capability of support vector regression (SVR), this paper presents an SVR model hybridized with the differential empirical mode decomposition (DEMD) method and quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm (QPSO) for electric load forecasting. The DEMD method is employed to decompose the electric load to several detail parts associated with high frequencies (intrinsic mode function-IMF) and an approximate part associated with low frequencies. Hybridized with quantum theory to enhance particle searching performance, the so-called QPSO is used to optimize the parameters of SVR. The electric load data of the New South Wales (Sydney, Australia) market and the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO, New York, USA) are used for comparing the forecasting performances of different forecasting models. The results illustrate the validity of the idea that the proposed model can simultaneously provide forecasting with good accuracy and interpretability.","2016-03","4/11/2022 15:14","5/12/2022 16:15",null,"221 (20 pp.)",null,"3","9",null,"Energies",null,"Energies (Switzerland)",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Place: Switzerland Publisher: MDPI AG",null,"; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\S9Y5ZW9B\\Li-Ling Peng et al. - 2016 - Hybridizing DEMD and Quantum PSO with SVR in Elect.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en9030221","regression analysis; load forecasting; particle swarm optimisation; support vector machines; included; reverse snowball; forward snowball",null,null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.75,0.866666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",0.662,null,"Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution"],["KQ92FIRT","journalArticle",2020,"Ruidas, Subhendu; Seikh, Mijanur Rahaman; Nayak, Prasun Kumar","An EPQ model with stock and selling price dependent demand and variable production rate in interval environment",19700177002.0,null,"International Journal of Systems Assurance Engineering and Management",null,"09756809","10.1007/s13198-019-00867-w",null,"Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","C","15","151","1512","The motto of this paper is to develop a production inventory model in real life situation. In reality, demand of a certain product becomes highly effected by on-hand stock level in stores and the selling price of the product. In the proposed model, demand of the product is dependent on these two vital deceive factors. In real life production systems, always there are some defective products which requires reworking in order to make them useful. The possibility of producing some defective items in regular production process and their reworking has been taken into account in the model. In case of inventories of highly demandable products, it is observed that production rate is proportional to demand. The situation also arises in case of launching a new product or in a multi-stage production system. In this model, production rate is a variable and it varies with the demand rate. Shortages are allowed and it is backlogged fully. Based on these assumptions, several researchers worked on but they considered that the associated inventory cost parameters are fixed real numbers. However, these are not fixed in reality and may vary time to time depending upon some scenario. Main objective of the paper is to develop a production inventory model under those assumptions considering various cost parameters as interval numbers. As a result the corresponding optimization problem is also interval valued. Quantum behaved particle swarm optimization technique has been applied to find the maximum profit in a single cycle. Numerical example and sensitivity analysis are given to illustrate the proposed inventory model.  2019, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.","2020","4/11/2022 15:14","5/4/2022 11:23",null,"385-399",null,"2","11",null,"International Journal of Systems Assurance Engineering and Management",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Publisher: Springer",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\TY5WT3EX\\Ruidas et al. - 2020 - An EPQ model with stock and selling price dependen.pdf;

The route planning for UAV on the sea is formulated as an optimization problem. A simple method of pretreatment to the terrain environment is proposed. A novel route planner for UAV is designed to generate a safe and flyable path in the presence of different threat environments based on the DEQPSO algorithm. To show the high performance of the proposed method, the DEQPSO algorithm is compared with the real-valued genetic algorithm, DE, standard particle swarm optimization (PSO), hybrid particle swarm with differential evolution operator, and QPSO in terms of the solution quality, robustness, and the convergence property.

In order to reduce the computational cost, a process optimization method for the coagulation process of carbon liber precursor spinning based on surrogate model was proposed. Using meta-modeling technology, this paper constructs the surrogate model which describes the relationship between the key operating parameters and the main output variables in the coagulation process. In the process of constructing the surrogate model, an evolutionary optimal sample point insertion criterion is adopted to improve the accuracy of the model.

With two competing objectives and a set of operation constraints, the economic environmental hydrothermal scheduling problem is classified as a typical multi-objective nonlinear constrained optimization problem. Thus, in order to efficiently resolve this problem, the multi-objective quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (MOQPSO) is presented in this paper. In MOQPSO, the elite archive set is adopted to conserve Pareto optimal solutions and provide multiple evolutionary directions for individuals, while the neighborhood searching and chaotic mutation strategies are used to enhance the search capability and diversity of population.

Therefore, the annual pumping cost decreased markedly 72% and 75%, with an overall decrease of total cost up to 30% and 27%, respectively, for the cases 1 and 2, respectively, showing the improvement potential of the proposed method, QPSOZ.","2012-09-01","4/27/2022 16:58","5/4/2022 12:44","4/27/2022 16:58","119-128",null,null,"42",null,"Applied Thermal Engineering",null,"Heat Powered Cycles Conference, 2009",null,null,null,null,null,"en",null,null,null,null,"ScienceDirect",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\7DZX8BL6\\Mariani et al. - 2012 - A chaotic quantum-behaved particle swarm approach .pdf; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\7K7DHSDE\\S1359431112001913.html",null,"included; forward snowball","Quantum particle swarm optimization; Economic optimization; Particle swarm optimization; Chaos theory; Heat exchanger design; Shell and tube heat exchanger (STHE)",null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.75,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",1.492,null,"Manufacturing","Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c.","Manufacture of general-purpose machinery","Manufacture of other general-purpose machinery"],["BJ2HEZHS","conferencePaper",2021,"Pushpabala, V.; ChristoberAsirRajan, C.","Energy Efficient Based Optimized Renewable Energy Systems (ORES) Using QPSO Technique for Normalized Cost of Energy (NCE)",null,null,"2021 International Conference on System, Computation, Automation and Networking (ICSCAN)",null,null,"10.1109/ICSCAN53069.2021.9526488",null,"Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Conference","D","35","351","3510","Numbers and charts of the world renewable energy agency and the International Energy Agency have lately shown that renewable energy sources (RES) have exceeded natural gas and have taken second place as a power source.

Studies have shown that various RES integrated into Optimized Renewable Energy Systems (ORES) may effectively manage these problems by applying appropriate optimization methods. This article provides a technique for optimising electricity produced by an example of the need for loads as the load of typical buildings to meet an ORES. Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization Technique (QPSO) is used as an algorithm to search for optimisation because of its advantages compared with other methods to reduce the standardised costs of energy, between production and demand taking account of losses;defined the problem and introduce the objective function with fitness in mind.

In this paper, the problem of resource leveling of linear projects under the framework of LSM is studied. Firstly, the concept of a third type of float is proposed, and the advantages of this third type of float to the optimization of linear project resource leveling are analyzed. On this basis, a two-stage optimization process of the linear project resource leveling problem based on the third type of float is proposed. The process takes into account new constraints such as total resource constraint, resource utilization constraint, and construction mileage constraint, and it aims to maximize the space-time flexibility of construction activities and realize the depth optimization of linear project resource leveling. According to the integer nonlinear characteristic of the model, a quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm with a constraint processing mechanism and particle search range restriction is designed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model is verified by case analysis and comparison of the results in previous studies.","2020","5/3/2022 16:13","5/15/2022 18:51",null,"176997-177020",null,null,"8",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\AGUAJ3LJ\\9207731.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\FPWAKFEV\\Wang et al. - 2020 - Float-Based Resource Leveling Optimization of Line.pdf",null,"included","Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; project management; Resource management; Schedules; Optimal scheduling; Acceleration; Linear project; optimal scheduling; quantum particle swarm; resource leveling",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.666666667,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",0.587,null,"Construction","Construction of buildings","Construction of buildings","Construction of buildings"],["5VPSAUHF","journalArticle",2021,"Ruidas, Subhendu; Seikh, Mijanur Rahaman; Nayak, Prasun Kumar","A production inventory model with interval-valued carbon emission parameters under price-sensitive demand",18164.0,null,"Computers & Industrial Engineering",null,"0360-8352","10.1016/j.cie.2021.107154","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360835221000589","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","M","70","701","7010","As environmental pollution has become a serious problem in recent years, production firms have now shifted their attention to lower the carbon emission level along with their financial goal. Now, one major drawback of the available models is that they consider the amount of carbon emission associated with various inventory processes like setup process, production process, inventory holding process, etc. as fixed numbers. However, these quantities may not be fixed in reality due to several factors, like the condition of the carbon filtrating apparatus in the production firm, machine breakdown, quality of the raw material, nature of the fuel or energy used, etc. The parameters may vary in between some certain ranges. This paper aims at developing an imperfect production inventory model under the various carbon emission regulatory policies where the various carbon emission parameters are interval numbers. The various inventory cost parameters are also represented as interval numbers to reflect the practical situation. The demand of the product is assumed to be a linearly decreasing function of the selling price of the product. Also, the idea of a new inventory cost component, referred to as the \u2018development cost\u2019 is introduced. Four different policies- simple tax policy, cap and purchase policy, cap and reward policy and strictly under permitted cap policy are discussed, and based on those policies four different inventory models are developed. The Quantum behaved Particle Swarm Optimization(QPSO) algorithm has been applied to find the optimal profit of the manufacturer. The optimal profit obtained here is also an interval number which is quite realistic. The traditional fuzzy or probabilistic approach to represent impreciseness fails to find such kind of solution. A numerical example for every case has been given to illustrate the applicability of the models. Finally, sensitivity analysis of the optimal feasible solution due to variation in some key parameters has been provided with the key managerial insights.","2021-04-01","5/4/2022 11:21","5/18/2022 11:46","5/4/2022 11:21","107154",null,null,"154",null,"Computers & Industrial Engineering",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"en",null,null,null,null,"ScienceDirect",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\ISRLT4XK\\Ruidas et al. - 2021 - A production inventory model with interval-valued .pdf",null,"included","Sustainable production;

Focusing on this problem, this paper has carried out a study on the multi-objective configuration optimization method (COM) and energy management strategy (EMS) for ship hybrid energy systems based on quantum computing. First, the mathematical model of distributed power modules of the hybrid energy system is established, and a configuration optimization objective function that aims at low-cost, long equipment life, and high reliability of power supply is constructed. Then, the combination with fuzzy rules and quantum multi-objective artificial bee colony algorithm to solve the objective function, the configuration scheme satisfying multiple constraints is obtained. On this basis, an energy management optimization objective function that meets both low-cost operation and maximum clean energy utilization for ship electric power system is established, an objective function is optimized in multi-objective quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm, the real-time optimal scheduling for hybrid energy systems of the ship is realized. Experiments on actual navigation data verify the feasibility of the multi-objective configuration optimization method using the quantum artificial bee colony (QABC) algorithm. Furthermore, energy management experiments using different strategies, experimental results show that the energy management strategy proposed in this paper outperforms other methods, effectively reduces the operating costs, fuel costs, and pollutant emissions of marine power system, meet the environmental requirements of the Energy Efficiency Operating Index (EEOI) for ships.","2022","5/11/2022 15:23","5/12/2022 23:07",null,"124131",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\Y4Z27BYU\\Si et al. - 2022 - Configuration optimization and energy management o.pdf",null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.75,0.733333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Not assigned","Not assigned",null,"Manufacturing","Manufacture of electrical equipment","Manufacture of electric motors, generators, transformers and electricity distribution and control apparatus","Manufacture of electric motors, generators, transformers and electricity distribution and control apparatus"],["AG8T9SYN","journalArticle",2021,"Ren, F.; Feng, W.","Homotopy-SQP coupled method for optimal control of far-distance nonplanar rapid cooperative rendezvous with multiple specific-direction thrusts",12375.0,null,"Advances in Space Research",null,null,"10.1016/j.asr.2021.06.019","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108534059&doi=10.1016%2fj.asr.2021.06.019&partnerID=40&md5=d0f1f164de3e477f78bbf3106d628f2c","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","H","52","522","5229",null,"2021","5/11/2022 16:08","5/13/2022 22:17",null,"3176-3190",null,"8","68",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Scopus",null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\AMEIJWDS\\Ren and Feng - 2021 - Homotopy-SQP coupled method for optimal control of.pdf; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\F9QSFPRB\\S0273117721004890.html",null,"included","Optimal control; Cooperative rendezvous; Multiple specific-direction thrusts; Indirect method; Intelligent algorithm",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","NO","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.555555556,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q2",0.613,null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Other transportation support activities"],["KPLNY54V","journalArticle",2021,"Ren, Fei","Optimization for Far-distance Cooperative Rendezvous with Multiple Direction-fixed Thrusts",130053.0,null,"Journal of Physics: Conference Series",null,null,"10.1088/1742-6596/2068/1/012021","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142466149","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","H","52","522","5229","The continuous-thrust far-distance cooperative rendezvous problem between two spacecraft is investigated. The indirect optimization method, based on Pontryagin\u2019s maximum principle (PMP), is applied to optimize fuel consumption. To overcome the difficulty in nonsmooth integration caused by the bang-bang control, the homotopy method is adopted to solve the fuel-optimal problem from a related energy-optimal problem. The quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is used to obtain the energy-optimal solutions. The energy-optimal solutions are used as the initial values for the homotopic procedure to obtain the fuel-optimal solutions and optimal bang-bang control law. A hybrid algorithm combined homotopy method and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm is proposed. This hybrid algorithm can effectively obtain feasible optimal solutions even though the indirect optimization method exhibits a narrow convergence domain. Simulations of high-thrust and low-thrust rendezvous problems are provided and the proposed hybrid algorithm is verified.

Given an initially clustered formation, a configuration, based on satellite coverage requirements, is set as the final configuration which the cluster aims to achieve, with minimal fuel consumption.

In this paper we propose to leverage their capabilities to address an important task for recommender systems providers, the optimal selection of recommendation carousels. In many video-on-demand and music streaming services the user is provided with a homepage containing several recommendation lists, i.e., carousels, each built with a certain criteria (e.g., artist, mood, Action movies etc.). Choosing which set of carousels to display is a difficult problem because it needs to account for how the different recommendation lists interact, e.g., avoiding duplicate recommendations, and how they help the user explore the catalogue. We focus in particular on the adiabatic computing paradigm and use the D-Wave quantum annealer, which is able to solve NP-hard optimization problems, can be programmed by classical operations research tools and is freely available on the cloud. We propose a formulation of the carousel selection problem for black box recommenders, that can be solved effectively on a quantum annealer and has the advantage of being simple.

In the present study, we formulate an Ising model to control a large number of automated guided vehicles in a factory without collision.

In this work we investigate the solvability of this problem with a D-Wave quantum annealer. These machines are optimizers for quadratic unconstrained optimization problems (QUBO). Therefore the flight gate assignment problem seems to be well suited for these machines. We use real world data from a mid-sized German airport as well as simulation based data to extract typical instances small enough to be amenable to the D-Wave machine. In order to mitigate precision problems, we employ bin packing on the passenger numbers to reduce the precision requirements of the extracted instances. We find that, for the instances we investigated, the bin packing has little effect on the solution quality.

In Asia, the traffic situation can be further deteriorated by road sharing of scooters. How to control the traffic flow to mitigate the congestion has been one of the central issues in transportation research. In this study, we employ a quantum annealing approach to optimize the traffic signals control at a real-life intersection with mixed traffic flows of vehicles and scooters. Considering traffic flow is a continuous and emerging phenomenon, we used quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formalism for traffic optimization, which has a natural equivalence to the Ising model and can be solved efficiently on the quantum annealers, quantum computers or digital annealers. In this article, we first applied the QUBO traffic optimization to artificially generated traffic for a simple intersection, and then we used real-time traffic data to simulate a real \"Dongda-Keyuan\" intersection with dedicated cars and scooter lanes, as well as mixed scooter and car lanes. We introduced two types of traffic light control systems for traffic optimization: C-QUBO and QUBO. Our rigorous QUBO optimizations show that C-QUBO and QUBO outperform the commonly used fixed cycle method, with QUBO outperforming C-QUBO in some instances. It has been found that QUBO optimization significantly relieves traffic congestion for the unbalanced traffic volume. Furthermore, we found that dynamic changes in traffic light signal duration greatly reduce traffic congestion.","2021-11","5/3/2022 15:49","5/13/2022 22:06",null,"74-81",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"ISSN: 2693-8421",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\S84X95F3\\9704985.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\L2YQSACW\\9704985.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\3ZULA6CL\\Singh et al. - 2021 - Quantum Annealing Approach for the Optimal Real-ti.pdf",null,"included","Annealing; Quantum annealing; Urban areas; Motorcycles; Real-time systems; quantum computing; quantum annealing; Correlation; QUBO; real-time optimization; Roads; traffic optimization; traffic signal control",null,"2021 IEEE/ACIS 22nd International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD)","YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.75,0.8,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"C","Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Other transportation support activities"],["GPT28I5I","conferencePaper",2019,"James, Scott Howard; Raheb, Robert Nicholas","Path Planning for Critical ATM/UTM Areas",null,null,"2019 IEEE/AIAA 38th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)",null,null,"10.1109/DASC43569.2019.9081662",null,"Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization",null,null,"Conference","H","52","522","5223","We create a path planning algorithm to be used in areas where conventional aircraft and Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAV) are in close proximity.

We examine a number of scenarios and compare the impact of communication latency on the intra-swarm and inter-swarm separations.","2020-09","5/4/2022 10:22","5/15/2022 20:57",null,"2G3-1-2G3-12",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"ISSN: 2155-4951",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\N982K4BP\\9223005.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\7VB7GKAT\\James et al. - 2020 - UAV Swarm Path Planning.pdf",null,"included","Computational modeling; Aircraft; Atmospheric modeling; Path planning; ATM; UTM; Autonomous aerial vehicles; Navigation; Surveillance; Swarm; UAV",null,"2020 Integrated Communications Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS)","NO",null,"YES",null,null,"YES","NO",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","NO","NO","NO","NO","YES",null,"NO",null,"YES","YES","NO","NO",null,"NO",0.5,0.230769231,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"Not assigned","Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Service activities incidental to air transportation"],["B7QM3W94","journalArticle",2019,"Ikeda, Kazuki; Nakamura, Yuma; Humble, Travis S.","Application of Quantum Annealing to Nurse Scheduling Problem",21100200805.0,null,"Scientific Reports",null,null,"10.1038/s41598-019-49172-3","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120878833","Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Journal","Q","86","861","8610","Quantum annealing is a promising heuristic method to solve combinatorial optimization problems, and efforts to quantify performance on real-world problems provide insights into how this approach may be best used in practice. We investigate the empirical performance of quantum annealing to solve the Nurse Scheduling Problem (NSP) with hard constraints using the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealing device. NSP seeks the optimal assignment for a set of nurses to shifts under an accompanying set of constraints on schedule and personnel. After reducing NSP to a novel Ising-type Hamiltonian, we evaluate the solution quality obtained from the D-Wave 2000Q against the constraint requirements as well as the diversity of solutions. For the test problems explored here, our results indicate that quantum annealing recovers satisfying solutions for NSP and suggests the heuristic method is potentially achievable for practical use. Moreover, we observe that solution quality can be greatly improved through the use of reverse annealing, in which it is possible to refine returned results by using the annealing process a second time. We compare the performance of NSP using both forward and reverse annealing methods and describe how this approach might be used in practice.","2019","5/4/2022 10:49","5/16/2022 16:18",null,"12837",null,"1","9",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.555555556,0.733333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",1.341,null,"Human health and social work activities","Human health activities","Hospital activities","Hospital activities"],["MXVUMVPM","conferencePaper",2021,"Henderson, Jessie M.; O\u2019Malley, Daniel; Viswanathan, Hari S.","Interrogating the performance of quantum annealing for the solution of steady-state subsurface flow",null,null,"2021 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)",null,null,"10.1109/HPEC49654.2021.9622819",null,"Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Conference","E","36","360","3600","In the 1990s, the principles of quantum mechanics were leveraged to describe how discrete combinatorial optimization problems could be solved using a method called quantum annealing.

In this paper we formulate the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, apply the hybrid framework of the D-Wave quantum annealer to solve it, and investigate the feasibility of this approach. To improve the often suboptimal initial solutions found on the D-Wave system, we develop a hybrid quantum/classical optimization algorithm that starts from the seed solution and iteratively creates small subproblems that are more efficiently solved on the D-Wave but often still converge to feasible and improved solutions of the original problem. Finally we suggest some opportunities for increasing the accuracy and performance of our algorithm.","2020","5/11/2022 15:39","5/16/2022 14:41",null,"531-545",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-50433-5_41",null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.666666667,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"A","Public administration and defence;

Because energy storage can improve the utilization rate of renewable energy, this paper establishes a storage capacity expansion planning model considering multiple functions of hybrid energy storage in the RIES. In this model, the wavelet packet decomposition method is used to reasonably decompose the high-frequency fluctuation and low-frequency fluctuation of renewable energy to achieve the function of stabilizing fluctuation. Meanwhile, an operation strategy for hybrid energy storage to participate in demand response is proposed. Rain flow counting method is used to research the life of hybrid energy storage system, which improves the accuracy of energy storage annual cost calculation. In the Simulation and Analysis section, the genetic quantum algorithm is used for simulation and analysis of the role and benefits of hybrid energy storage. The simulation results show that the benefit of hybrid energy storage in capacity expansion construction is increased by 10.4%, and when the electricity and gas prices fluctuate by \u00b120%, the hybrid energy storage configuration proposed in this paper has a stable advantage in more than 95%.","2020-11-05","4/11/2022 15:14","5/3/2022 17:35",null,"115834",null,null,"180",null,"Applied Thermal Engineering",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\R7X7P2WV\\Wang et al. - 2020 - Research on capacity planning and optimization of .pdf",null,"Hybrid energy storage; Capacity expansion planning; Rain flow cycle counting; Regional integrated energy system; Wavelet packet decomposition; included; reverse snowball; forward snowball",null,null,null,"NO",null,"YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.571428571,0.785714286,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",1.714,null,"Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution"],["JIWCMG59","conferencePaper",2015,"Liang, H.; Yan, L.; Yu, L.; Han, J.","Design of micro-grid with biogas power generation",null,null,"International Conference on Renewable Power Generation (RPG 2015)",null,null,"10.1049/cp.2015.0572","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84962663891&partnerID=40&md5=71d630cece2c4ef19cae256c43d14cf1","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Genetic Algorithm",null,null,"Conference","D","35","351","3510",null,"2015","4/11/2022 15:15","5/11/2022 14:45",null,null,null,null,"2015",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Scopus",null,null,null,"Issue: CP679",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\IT22UH53\\Liang et al. - 2015 - Design of micro-grid with biogas power generation.pdf",null,"included; reverse snowball; forward snowball",null,null,"IET Conference Publications","NO",null,"YES",null,null,"YES","NO",null,"NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES",null,"YES","NO","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.333333333,0.538461538,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"Not assigned","Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution"],["2BVF67EM","journalArticle",2012,"Tang, Xin Lai; Yang, Shu Hong","A Improved Bus Timetable Scheduling Model Using Quantum Genetic Algorithm Based on Penalty Strategy",4700151914.0,null,"Applied Mechanics and Materials",null,"1662-7482","10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.253-255.1406","https://www.scientific.net/AMM.253-255.1406","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Genetic Algorithm",null,null,"Journal","H","52","522","5229","Considering the influence that the cycles of signal lamp have on the waiting time, a bus scheduling model is presented in this paper based on the trade-off between the cost of bus operator and benefits of passengers.

Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA), which originates from the organic integration of quantum computing and genetic algorithms, has the advantages of outstanding ability to seek optimal solutions, faster computing speed and smaller overall computing scale, and can solve multi-objective scheduling or optimization problems well. In this paper, the QGA's principle, method and basic flow is introduced, the constraints of the complex curriculum arrangement problem is discussed, and a method to solve the problem of course scheduling in colleges and universities by using this advanced algorithm is also given.

After comparing the algorithm used in this paper with several other algorithms commonly used to solve optimization problems, the results show that the algorithm used in this paper is able to find the optimal solution most quickly and accurately (i.e. to obtain the minimum cost for power generation in the shortest time).

Most often software product developments are iterative and incremental in their nature, due to the changes in the customer requirements from time to time. It is a challenging task to select the requirements from a large number of candidates, for the accomplishment of the business goals. The problem is to identify a set of requirements to be included in the next release of the product, by minimizing the cost and maximizing the customer satisfaction. Since minimizing the total cost and maximizing the customer satisfaction are contradictory objectives, the problem has a multi-objective nature. This problem is NP-hard in its nature and so it cannot be solved efficiently by using traditional optimization techniques for large problem instances. QEMEA combines the best features of Evolutionary Algorithms and Quantum Computing. It employs the concepts of Quantum computing such as superposition and interference. The features of QEMEA help in achieving quality pareto-optimal front solutions and faster convergence while using a small population size. The performance of QEMEA is tested on six benchmark problems derived from the literature. The obtained results indicates consistent and superior performance of the algorithm.","2012-03","4/24/2022 22:18","5/4/2022 12:40",null,"782-787",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\KLUCFBGY\\6215945.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\VDFELL8Q\\Charan Kumari et al. - 2012 - Software requirements selection using Quantum-insp.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball","Benchmark testing; Multi-objective Next Release Problem; Quantum-inspired Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm; Search based software engineering; Software requirements selection",null,"IEEE-International Conference On Advances In Engineering, Science And Management (ICAESM -2012)","NO",null,"NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.375,0.714285714,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"Not assigned","Information and communication","Computer programming, consultancy and related activities","Computer programming, consultancy and related activities","Computer programming activities"],["ST9KHN6W","journalArticle",2011,"Arpaia, P.; Maisto, D.; Manna, C.","A Quantum-inspired Evolutionary Algorithm with a competitive variation operator for Multiple-Fault Diagnosis",18136.0,null,"Applied Soft Computing",null,"1568-4946","10.1016/j.asoc.2011.07.017","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156849461100278X","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum-inspired Evolutionary Algorithm",null,null,"Journal","C","33","331","3319","A heuristic search algorithm, the Quantum-inspired Competitive Evolutionary Algorithm (QuCEA), based on both quantum and evolutionary computing, is proposed.

Rational gate allocation is regarded as one of the most important means to solve this bottleneck. In this paper, in order to comprehensively considere different stakeholders, a three-objective gate allocation model is to consider a wider scope, in which the minimizing passenger walking distances, the most balanced idle time of each gate and the best full use of large gate are optimized simultaneously to improve the practical efficiency. To efficiently solve this model, an improved quantum evolutionary algorithm (QEA) based on the niche co-evolution strategy and enhanced particle swarm optimization (PSO), namely IPOQEA is designed. An IPOQEA-based gate allocation method is proposed to allocate the flights to suitable gates within different periods. Finally, the actual operation data of Baiyun Airport is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Comparison results show that the constructed model can address the passenger walking distances, robustness and costs in airport management. Moreover, the IPOQEA has better optimization ability in solving gate allocation problem. Therefore, the proposed gate allocation method has great potential for practical engineering since it can easily make decisions for airport managers.","2022-03","5/4/2022 10:25","5/13/2022 21:03",null,"1737-1745",null,"3","23",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\SD597D35\\9210735.html;

The analyses suggest that the good solutions are clustered in the search space and there is a correlation between the \ufb01tness of a local optimum and its distance to the best solution. Inspired by these \ufb01ndings, a new operator for Quantum Evolutionary Algorithms is proposed which, during the search process, collects information about the \ufb01tness landscape and tried to capture the backbone structure of the landscape. The knowledge it has collected is used to guide the search process towards a better region in the search space. The proposed algorithm consists of two phases. The \ufb01rst phase uses a tabu mechanism to collect information about the \ufb01tness landscape. In the second phase, the collected data are processed to guide the algorithm towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm clusters the good solutions it has found in its previous search process. Then when the population is converged and trapped in a local optimum, it is divided into sub-populations and each sub-population is designated to a cluster. The information in the database is then used to reinitialize the q-individuals, so they represent better regions in the search space. This way the population maintains diversity and by capturing the \ufb01tness landscape structure, the algorithm is guided towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm is compared with some state-ofthe-art algorithms from PATAT competition conferences and experimental results are presented.","2021-04","5/4/2022 14:30","5/13/2022 22:40","5/4/2022 14:30","114211",null,null,"168",null,"Expert Systems with Applications","How to exploit fitness landscape properties of timetabling problem",null,null,null,null,null,null,"en",null,null,null,null,"DOI.org (Crossref)",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\AKDUX97Q\\Najaran - 2021 - How to exploit fitness landscape properties of tim.pdf",null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.875,0.6,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",2.07,null,"Professional, scientific and technical activities","Activities of head offices; management consultancy activities","Activities of head offices","Activities of head offices"]],"hovertemplate":"<b>S<sub>S</sub>: %{x}</b><br>S<sub>R</sub>: %{customdata[82]}<br>DOI: %{customdata[10]}","marker":{"outliercolor":"black"},"meanline":{"color":"black","visible":true},"name":"Quantum-inspired Evolutionary Algorithm","points":"all","x":[0.555555556,0.625,0.375,0.875,0.75,0.666666667,0.777777778,0.666666667,0.666666667,0.875],"type":"violin"}],                        {"template":{"data":{"pie":[{"automargin":true,"type":"pie"}]},"layout":{"xaxis":{"showgrid":true,"title":{"standoff":15}},"yaxis":{"showgrid":true,"title":{"standoff":15}}}},"xaxis":{"range":[0,1],"title":{"text":"$S_S$"}},"yaxis":{"title":{"text":"Algorithm Name"}},"margin":{"l":300},"showlegend":false},                        {"responsive": true}                    )                };                            </script>        </div>
