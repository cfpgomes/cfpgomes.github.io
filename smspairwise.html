Here, CEED is represented using cubic criterion function to reduce the nonlinearities of the system. Along with economic load dispatch, emissions of SO2, NOx, and CO2 are considered as separate three objectives, thus making it a four-objective (many-objective) optimization problem. A unit-wise price penalty factor is considered here to convert all the objectives into a single objective in order to compare the final results with other previously used methods like Lagrangian relaxation (LR), particle swarm optimization, and simulated annealing. QBA is applied in six-unit power generation system for four different loads. The obtained results show QBA successfully solve many-objective CEED problem with greater superiority than other methods found in the literature in terms of quality results, robustness, and computational performance. In the end of this paper, a detailed future research direction is provided based on the simulation results and its analysis. The outcome of this research demonstrates that the inclusion of quantum computing idea in metaheuristic technique provides a useful and reliable tool for solving such many-objective optimization problem.","2019-10","4/11/2022 15:14","5/11/2022 16:34",null,"5857-69",null,"10","31",null,"Neural Computing and Applications",null,"Neural Comput.

The DEMD method is employed to decompose the electric load to several detail parts associated with high frequencies (intrinsic mode function-IMF) and an approximate part associated with low frequencies. Hybridized with quantum theory to enhance particle searching performance, the so-called QPSO is used to optimize the parameters of SVR. The electric load data of the New South Wales (Sydney, Australia) market and the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO, New York, USA) are used for comparing the forecasting performances of different forecasting models.

In reality, demand of a certain product becomes highly effected by on-hand stock level in stores and the selling price of the product. In the proposed model, demand of the product is dependent on these two vital deceive factors. In real life production systems, always there are some defective products which requires reworking in order to make them useful. The possibility of producing some defective items in regular production process and their reworking has been taken into account in the model. In case of inventories of highly demandable products, it is observed that production rate is proportional to demand. The situation also arises in case of launching a new product or in a multi-stage production system. In this model, production rate is a variable and it varies with the demand rate. Shortages are allowed and it is backlogged fully. Based on these assumptions, several researchers worked on but they considered that the associated inventory cost parameters are fixed real numbers. However, these are not fixed in reality and may vary time to time depending upon some scenario. Main objective of the paper is to develop a production inventory model under those assumptions considering various cost parameters as interval numbers. As a result the corresponding optimization problem is also interval valued. Quantum behaved particle swarm optimization technique has been applied to find the maximum profit in a single cycle. Numerical example and sensitivity analysis are given to illustrate the proposed inventory model.  2019, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.","2020","4/11/2022 15:14","5/4/2022 11:23",null,"385-399",null,"2","11",null,"International Journal of Systems Assurance Engineering and Management",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Publisher: Springer",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\TY5WT3EX\\Ruidas et al. - 2020 - An EPQ model with stock and selling price dependen.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13198-019-00867-w","Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Numerical methods; Sensitivity analysis; Inventory control; Defects; included; reverse snowball; forward snowball",null,null,null,"NO",null,"NO","YES",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.25,0.857142857,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q3",0.3,null,"Manufacturing","Manufacture of leather and related products","Tanning and dressing of leather; manufacture of luggage, handbags, saddlery and harness; dressing and dyeing of fur","Manufacture of luggage, handbags and the like, saddlery and harness"],["EEM6Q2MC","journalArticle",2020,"Wang, Yongli; Song, Fuhao; Ma, Yuze; Zhang, Yuli; Yang, Jiale; Liu, Yang; Zhang, Fuwei; Zhu, Jinrong","Research on capacity planning and optimization of regional integrated energy system based on hybrid energy storage system",13688.0,null,"Applied Thermal Engineering",null,"1359-4311","10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2020.115834","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359431120333160","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Genetic Algorithm",null,null,"Journal","D","35","351","3510","Some regional integrated energy systems (RIES) have installed equipments such as wind turbine and photovoltaic, but the fluctuation of these intermittent power supply is large, resulting in a certain amount of energy waste.

In this model, the wavelet packet decomposition method is used to reasonably decompose the high-frequency fluctuation and low-frequency fluctuation of renewable energy to achieve the function of stabilizing fluctuation. Meanwhile, an operation strategy for hybrid energy storage to participate in demand response is proposed. Rain flow counting method is used to research the life of hybrid energy storage system, which improves the accuracy of energy storage annual cost calculation. In the Simulation and Analysis section, the genetic quantum algorithm is used for simulation and analysis of the role and benefits of hybrid energy storage. The simulation results show that the benefit of hybrid energy storage in capacity expansion construction is increased by 10.4%, and when the electricity and gas prices fluctuate by \u00b120%, the hybrid energy storage configuration proposed in this paper has a stable advantage in more than 95%.","2020-11-05","4/11/2022 15:14","5/3/2022 17:35",null,"115834",null,null,"180",null,"Applied Thermal Engineering",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\R7X7P2WV\\Wang et al. - 2020 - Research on capacity planning and optimization of .pdf",null,"Hybrid energy storage;

It is a challenging task to select the requirements from a large number of candidates, for the accomplishment of the business goals. The problem is to identify a set of requirements to be included in the next release of the product, by minimizing the cost and maximizing the customer satisfaction. Since minimizing the total cost and maximizing the customer satisfaction are contradictory objectives, the problem has a multi-objective nature. This problem is NP-hard in its nature and so it cannot be solved efficiently by using traditional optimization techniques for large problem instances. QEMEA combines the best features of Evolutionary Algorithms and Quantum Computing. It employs the concepts of Quantum computing such as superposition and interference. The features of QEMEA help in achieving quality pareto-optimal front solutions and faster convergence while using a small population size. The performance of QEMEA is tested on six benchmark problems derived from the literature. The obtained results indicates consistent and superior performance of the algorithm.","2012-03","4/24/2022 22:18","5/4/2022 12:40",null,"782-787",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\KLUCFBGY\\6215945.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\VDFELL8Q\\Charan Kumari et al. - 2012 - Software requirements selection using Quantum-insp.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball","Benchmark testing; Multi-objective Next Release Problem; Quantum-inspired Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm; Search based software engineering; Software requirements selection",null,"IEEE-International Conference On Advances In Engineering, Science And Management (ICAESM -2012)","NO",null,"NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.375,0.714285714,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"Not assigned","Information and communication","Computer programming, consultancy and related activities","Computer programming, consultancy and related activities","Computer programming activities"],["ITNK88F2","conferencePaper",2020,"Sheng, Jiangfan; Kong, Weijian; Qi, Jie","Process optimization of carbon fiber precursor spinning coagulation process based on surrogate model",null,null,"2020 Chinese Automation Congress (CAC)",null,null,"10.1109/CAC51589.2020.9326779",null,"Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Conference","C","23","239","2399","High-quality carbon fiber precursor is the key to the manufacture of high-performance carbon fiber, and the coagulation process is one of the key steps in the preparation of the precursor.

Therefore, iterative optimization based on its strict mechanism model will be much time-consuming. In order to reduce the computational cost, a process optimization method for the coagulation process of carbon liber precursor spinning based on surrogate model was proposed. Using meta-modeling technology, this paper constructs the surrogate model which describes the relationship between the key operating parameters and the main output variables in the coagulation process. In the process of constructing the surrogate model, an evolutionary optimal sample point insertion criterion is adopted to improve the accuracy of the model. And the quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is applied for searching operating parameters in the design space.

In order to obtain better optimization results, a parameter adaptive control method is used to update the crossover probability. And the problem of multi-objective optimization is solved by introducing a penalty factor. The experimental results show that: the evaluation index and convergence speed of the DE-CQPSO algorithm are better than QPSO (Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization) and other algorithms, whether it is single-objective optimization of fuel cost and emissions or multi-objective optimization considering both optimization objectives. A good compromise value is verified, which verifies the effectiveness and robustness of the DE-CQPSO algorithm in solving environmental economic dispatch problems.

Economic dispatch problem refers to the minimization of generation cost, where environmental dispatch problem refers to the minimization of emission of pollutants like CO2, SO2, and NOx from the power generation system. A quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization (QPSO) technique is presented in this paper to solve many-objective environmental economic dispatch (EED) problems. Emissions of CO2, SO2, and NOx are considered 3 different objectives, thus making it a 4-objective problem considering ED. Many-objective EED problems are defined by using a cubic criterion function, and a max/max price penalty factor is considered to convert all the objectives into a single objective to compare the final results with other well-known methods found in the literature like Lagrangian relaxation, particle swarm optimization, simulated annealing, and quantum-behaved bat algorithm. Quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization is implemented on a 6-unit system to solve many-objective EED problems, and at the same time, to show the effectiveness of QPSO in large systems, it is also implemented in a 26-unit power generation system for ED problem. The obtained results demonstrate and verify the effectiveness and robustness of QPSO to solve many-objective EED problems.

How to control the traffic flow to mitigate the congestion has been one of the central issues in transportation research. In this study, we employ a quantum annealing approach to optimize the traffic signals control at a real-life intersection with mixed traffic flows of vehicles and scooters. Considering traffic flow is a continuous and emerging phenomenon, we used quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formalism for traffic optimization, which has a natural equivalence to the Ising model and can be solved efficiently on the quantum annealers, quantum computers or digital annealers. In this article, we first applied the QUBO traffic optimization to artificially generated traffic for a simple intersection, and then we used real-time traffic data to simulate a real \"Dongda-Keyuan\" intersection with dedicated cars and scooter lanes, as well as mixed scooter and car lanes. We introduced two types of traffic light control systems for traffic optimization: C-QUBO and QUBO. Our rigorous QUBO optimizations show that C-QUBO and QUBO outperform the commonly used fixed cycle method, with QUBO outperforming C-QUBO in some instances. It has been found that QUBO optimization significantly relieves traffic congestion for the unbalanced traffic volume. Furthermore, we found that dynamic changes in traffic light signal duration greatly reduce traffic congestion.","2021-11","5/3/2022 15:49","5/13/2022 22:06",null,"74-81",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"ISSN: 2693-8421",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\S84X95F3\\9704985.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\L2YQSACW\\9704985.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\3ZULA6CL\\Singh et al. - 2021 - Quantum Annealing Approach for the Optimal Real-ti.pdf",null,"included","Annealing; Quantum annealing; Urban areas; Motorcycles; Real-time systems; quantum computing; quantum annealing; Correlation; QUBO; real-time optimization; Roads; traffic optimization; traffic signal control",null,"2021 IEEE/ACIS 22nd International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD)","YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.75,0.8,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"C","Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Other transportation support activities"],["BJ2HEZHS","conferencePaper",2021,"Pushpabala, V.; ChristoberAsirRajan, C.","Energy Efficient Based Optimized Renewable Energy Systems (ORES) Using QPSO Technique for Normalized Cost of Energy (NCE)",null,null,"2021 International Conference on System, Computation, Automation and Networking (ICSCAN)",null,null,"10.1109/ICSCAN53069.2021.9526488",null,"Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Conference","D","35","351","3510","Numbers and charts of the world renewable energy agency and the International Energy Agency have lately shown that renewable energy sources (RES) have exceeded natural gas and have taken second place as a power source.

It is observed that the proposed approach provides a fuel cost saving of up to 1300$ when compared with other referred techniques.","2021","5/3/2022 16:13","5/15/2022 17:07",null,"1-26",null,"6","16",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\TTZNMCMB\\Bodha et al. - 2021 - A novel quantum inspired hybrid metaheuristic for .pdf; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\JSG7JKYW\\15567249.2021.html",null,"included","Binary encoded problems; combinatorial optimization; combined economic emission dispatch; mixed integer optimization problem; quantum evolutionary algorithm; rotation quantum gate",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO",null,"YES",0.666666667,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",0.802,null,"Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution"],["MDAPFYBQ","journalArticle",2022,"Deng, Wu; Xu, Junjie; Zhao, Huimin; Song, Yingjie","A Novel Gate Resource Allocation Method Using Improved PSO-Based QEA",18378.0,null,"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems",null,"1558-0016","10.1109/TITS.2020.3025796",null,"Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum-inspired Evolutionary Algorithm",null,null,"Journal","H","52","522","5223","With the continuous and rapid growth of air traffic demand, gate resource becomes a major bottleneck restricting airport development. Rational gate allocation is regarded as one of the most important means to solve this bottleneck. In this paper, in order to comprehensively considere different stakeholders, a three-objective gate allocation model is to consider a wider scope, in which the minimizing passenger walking distances, the most balanced idle time of each gate and the best full use of large gate are optimized simultaneously to improve the practical efficiency. To efficiently solve this model, an improved quantum evolutionary algorithm (QEA) based on the niche co-evolution strategy and enhanced particle swarm optimization (PSO), namely IPOQEA is designed. An IPOQEA-based gate allocation method is proposed to allocate the flights to suitable gates within different periods. Finally, the actual operation data of Baiyun Airport is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Comparison results show that the constructed model can address the passenger walking distances, robustness and costs in airport management. Moreover, the IPOQEA has better optimization ability in solving gate allocation problem. Therefore, the proposed gate allocation method has great potential for practical engineering since it can easily make decisions for airport managers.","2022-03","5/4/2022 10:25","5/13/2022 21:03",null,"1737-1745",null,"3","23",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\SD597D35\\9210735.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\AVL4TNSW\\Deng et al. - 2022 - A Novel Gate Resource Allocation Method Using Impr.pdf",null,"included","Optimization; Logic gates; Airports; Resource management; Statistics; Sociology; Atmospheric modeling; Gate allocation model; improved rotation gates; multi-objective; niche co-evolution strategy; PSO; QEA",null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.75,0.6,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Not assigned","Not assigned",null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Service activities incidental to air transportation"],["5VPSAUHF","journalArticle",2021,"Ruidas, Subhendu; Seikh, Mijanur Rahaman; Nayak, Prasun Kumar","A production inventory model with interval-valued carbon emission parameters under price-sensitive demand",18164.0,null,"Computers & Industrial Engineering",null,"0360-8352","10.1016/j.cie.2021.107154","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360835221000589","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","M","70","701","7010","As environmental pollution has become a serious problem in recent years, production firms have now shifted their attention to lower the carbon emission level along with their financial goal. Now, one major drawback of the available models is that they consider the amount of carbon emission associated with various inventory processes like setup process, production process, inventory holding process, etc. as fixed numbers. However, these quantities may not be fixed in reality due to several factors, like the condition of the carbon filtrating apparatus in the production firm, machine breakdown, quality of the raw material, nature of the fuel or energy used, etc. The parameters may vary in between some certain ranges. This paper aims at developing an imperfect production inventory model under the various carbon emission regulatory policies where the various carbon emission parameters are interval numbers. The various inventory cost parameters are also represented as interval numbers to reflect the practical situation. The demand of the product is assumed to be a linearly decreasing function of the selling price of the product. Also, the idea of a new inventory cost component, referred to as the \u2018development cost\u2019 is introduced. Four different policies- simple tax policy, cap and purchase policy, cap and reward policy and strictly under permitted cap policy are discussed, and based on those policies four different inventory models are developed. The Quantum behaved Particle Swarm Optimization(QPSO) algorithm has been applied to find the optimal profit of the manufacturer. The optimal profit obtained here is also an interval number which is quite realistic. The traditional fuzzy or probabilistic approach to represent impreciseness fails to find such kind of solution. A numerical example for every case has been given to illustrate the applicability of the models. Finally, sensitivity analysis of the optimal feasible solution due to variation in some key parameters has been provided with the key managerial insights.","2021-04-01","5/4/2022 11:21","5/18/2022 11:46","5/4/2022 11:21","107154",null,null,"154",null,"Computers & Industrial Engineering",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"en",null,null,null,null,"ScienceDirect",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\ISRLT4XK\\Ruidas et al. - 2021 - A production inventory model with interval-valued .pdf",null,"included","Sustainable production;

In this paper, we propose an improved quantum chaotic animal migration optimization algorithm to solve the multicast routing problem (Multi-Constrained Least Cost MCLC). We used a quantum representation of the solutions that allow the use of the original AMO version without discretization, as well as improving AMO by introducing chaotic map to determine the random numbers. These two contributions improve the diversification and intensification of the algorithm. The simulation results show that our proposed algorithm has a good scalability and efficiency compared with other existing algorithms in the literature.","2018","5/4/2022 12:34","5/16/2022 19:11",null,"128-139",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-89743-1_12",null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.777777778,0.733333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"Not assigned","Information and communication","Information service activities","Data processing, hosting and related activities;

The analyses suggest that the good solutions are clustered in the search space and there is a correlation between the \ufb01tness of a local optimum and its distance to the best solution. Inspired by these \ufb01ndings, a new operator for Quantum Evolutionary Algorithms is proposed which, during the search process, collects information about the \ufb01tness landscape and tried to capture the backbone structure of the landscape. The knowledge it has collected is used to guide the search process towards a better region in the search space. The proposed algorithm consists of two phases. The \ufb01rst phase uses a tabu mechanism to collect information about the \ufb01tness landscape. In the second phase, the collected data are processed to guide the algorithm towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm clusters the good solutions it has found in its previous search process. Then when the population is converged and trapped in a local optimum, it is divided into sub-populations and each sub-population is designated to a cluster. The information in the database is then used to reinitialize the q-individuals, so they represent better regions in the search space. This way the population maintains diversity and by capturing the \ufb01tness landscape structure, the algorithm is guided towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm is compared with some state-ofthe-art algorithms from PATAT competition conferences and experimental results are presented.","2021-04","5/4/2022 14:30","5/13/2022 22:40","5/4/2022 14:30","114211",null,null,"168",null,"Expert Systems with Applications","How to exploit fitness landscape properties of timetabling problem",null,null,null,null,null,null,"en",null,null,null,null,"DOI.org (Crossref)",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\AKDUX97Q\\Najaran - 2021 - How to exploit fitness landscape properties of tim.pdf",null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.875,0.6,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",2.07,null,"Professional, scientific and technical activities","Activities of head offices;

This paper proposes a novel technique for accurate failure prognosis based on back propagation neural network and quantum multi-agent algorithm. Inspired by the extensive research of quantum computing theory and multi-agent systems, the technique employs a quantum multi-agent strategy, with the main characteristics of quantum agent representation and several operations including fitness evaluation, cooperation, crossover and mutation, for parameters optimization of neural network to avoid the deficiencies such as slow convergence and liability of getting stuck to local minima. To validate the feasibility of the proposed approach, several numerical approximation experiments were firstly designed, after which real vibrational data of bearings from the Laboratory of Cincinnati University were analyzed and used to assess the health condition for a given future point. The results were rather encouraging and indicated that the presented forecasting method has the potential to be utilized as an estimation tool for failure prediction in industrial machinery.","2016-06-01","5/5/2022 18:26","5/16/2022 21:07","5/5/2022 18:26","210-228",null,"2","25",null,"J.

Focusing on this problem, this paper has carried out a study on the multi-objective configuration optimization method (COM) and energy management strategy (EMS) for ship hybrid energy systems based on quantum computing. First, the mathematical model of distributed power modules of the hybrid energy system is established, and a configuration optimization objective function that aims at low-cost, long equipment life, and high reliability of power supply is constructed. Then, the combination with fuzzy rules and quantum multi-objective artificial bee colony algorithm to solve the objective function, the configuration scheme satisfying multiple constraints is obtained. On this basis, an energy management optimization objective function that meets both low-cost operation and maximum clean energy utilization for ship electric power system is established, an objective function is optimized in multi-objective quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm, the real-time optimal scheduling for hybrid energy systems of the ship is realized. Experiments on actual navigation data verify the feasibility of the multi-objective configuration optimization method using the quantum artificial bee colony (QABC) algorithm.

The indirect optimization method, based on Pontryagin\u2019s maximum principle (PMP), is applied to optimize fuel consumption. To overcome the difficulty in nonsmooth integration caused by the bang-bang control, the homotopy method is adopted to solve the fuel-optimal problem from a related energy-optimal problem. The quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is used to obtain the energy-optimal solutions. The energy-optimal solutions are used as the initial values for the homotopic procedure to obtain the fuel-optimal solutions and optimal bang-bang control law. A hybrid algorithm combined homotopy method and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm is proposed. This hybrid algorithm can effectively obtain feasible optimal solutions even though the indirect optimization method exhibits a narrow convergence domain. Simulations of high-thrust and low-thrust rendezvous problems are provided and the proposed hybrid algorithm is verified.

The bat algorithm (BA) is an acknowledged metaheuristic optimization algorithm owing to its performance. However, the classical BA presents some weaknesses, such as premature convergence. To withstand the drawbacks of the BA, quantum mechanics theories and Gaussian and Cauchy operators are integrated into the standard BA to enhance its effectiveness. Since the economic load dispatch is a nonlinear, complex and constrained optimization problem, its main objective is to reduce the total generation cost while matching the equality and inequality constraints of the system. The validity of the CGQBA is tested on six standard benchmark functions with different characteristics. The numerical results indicate that the CGQBA is effective and superior to many other algorithms. Moreover, the CGQBA is applied to solve the ELD problems on various test systems including 3,6,20, 40,110 and 160 implemented generating units. The simulation results illustrate the strength of the CGQBA compared with other algorithms recently reported in the literature.","2021","5/11/2022 14:23","5/13/2022 22:09",null,"3207-3228",null,null,"9",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.777777778,0.733333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",0.927,null,"Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution"],["6ZTAZZTA","conferencePaper",2021,"Soyinka Olukunle, K.; Nwanze, Nzekwu; Akoma Henry, E.

It was only recently that small but functional quantum computers have become available on the cloud, allowing to test their potential. In this paper we propose to leverage their capabilities to address an important task for recommender systems providers, the optimal selection of recommendation carousels. In many video-on-demand and music streaming services the user is provided with a homepage containing several recommendation lists, i.e., carousels, each built with a certain criteria (e.g., artist, mood, Action movies etc.). Choosing which set of carousels to display is a difficult problem because it needs to account for how the different recommendation lists interact, e.g., avoiding duplicate recommendations, and how they help the user explore the catalogue. We focus in particular on the adiabatic computing paradigm and use the D-Wave quantum annealer, which is able to solve NP-hard optimization problems, can be programmed by classical operations research tools and is freely available on the cloud. We propose a formulation of the carousel selection problem for black box recommenders, that can be solved effectively on a quantum annealer and has the advantage of being simple. We discuss its effectiveness, limitations and possible future directions of development.  2021 Owner/Author.","2021","4/11/2022 15:14","5/13/2022 22:04",null,"691-696",null,null,null,null,null,null,"RecSys 2021 - 15th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems",null,null,null,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","Virtual, Online, Netherlands",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\B9BIPMP8\\Ferrari Dacrema et al. - 2021 - Optimizing the selection of recommendation carouse.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3460231.3478853","Optimization; Annealing; Quantum computers; Recommender systems; Operations research; User interfaces; Video on demand; included; reverse snowball; forward snowball",null,null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","NO",null,"NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",0.714285714,0.866666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"A","Information and communication","Information service activities","Data processing, hosting and related activities; web portals","Data processing, hosting and related activities"],["G5PG4F3Y","conferencePaper",2020,"Fernandes, Clifford; Lobo, Desmond; Gawane, Sarang; Wagaskar, Kalpita","Proposed quantum AI solution for the travelling tournament problem",null,null,"2020 International Conference for Emerging Technology, INCET 2020, June 5, 2020  -  June 7, 2020",null,null,"10.1109/INCET49848.2020.9154037",null,"Hybrid","Quantum","Quantum Circuit",null,"Gate-based","Conference","R","93","931","9312","In this paper, we propose an idea/solution for the Travelling Tournament Problem, which is a unique combinatorial problem tackling both feasibility and optimality of the solution.

In this paper, we present a real-world application that uses quantum technologies. Specifically, we show how to map certain parts of a real-world traffic flow optimization problem to be suitable for quantum annealing. We show that time-critical optimization tasks, such as continuous redistribution of position data for cars in dense road networks, are suitable candidates for quantum computing.

In this system, we perform a specific protocol of quantum annealing to attain the ground state, the minimizer of the energy. Therefore the device is often called the quantum annealer. However the resulting spin configurations are not always in the ground state. It can rather quickly generate many spin configurations following the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution. In the present study, we formulate an Ising model to control a large number of automated guided vehicles in a factory without collision.

Compared to the conventional powerful techniques performed in digital computer, still the quantum annealer does not show outstanding advantage in the practical problem.

Among others, an important goal is the minimization of the total transit time of the passengers. The corresponding objective function is quadratic in the binary decision variables encoding the flight-to-gate assignment. Hence, it is a quadratic assignment problem being hard to solve in general. In this work we investigate the solvability of this problem with a D-Wave quantum annealer. These machines are optimizers for quadratic unconstrained optimization problems (QUBO). Therefore the flight gate assignment problem seems to be well suited for these machines. We use real world data from a mid-sized German airport as well as simulation based data to extract typical instances small enough to be amenable to the D-Wave machine. In order to mitigate precision problems, we employ bin packing on the passenger numbers to reduce the precision requirements of the extracted instances. We find that, for the instances we investigated, the bin packing has little effect on the solution quality. Hence, we were able to solve small problem instances extracted from real data with the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer.","2019","4/25/2022 14:01","5/13/2022 22:04",null,"99-110",null,null,null,null,null,null,"Lecture Notes in Computer Science",null,null,null,"Springer International Publishing","Cham","en",null,null,null,null,"Springer Link",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\2MYGAWJY\\Stollenwerk et al. - 2019 - Flight Gate Assignment with a Quantum Annealer.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball","Quantum annealing; Airport planning; Quadratic assignment problem; QUBO","Feld, Sebastian; Linnhoff-Popien, Claudia",null,"NO",null,"YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES",null,"NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.571428571,0.642857143,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Service activities incidental to air transportation"],["VC9K5BV6","journalArticle",2020,"Stollenwerk, Tobias; O\u2019Gorman, Bryan; Venturelli, Davide; Mandr\u00e0, Salvatore; Rodionova, Olga; Ng, Hokkwan; Sridhar, Banavar; Rieffel, Eleanor Gilbert; Biswas, Rupak","Quantum Annealing Applied to De-Conflicting Optimal Trajectories for Air Traffic Management",18378.0,null,"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems",null,"1558-0016","10.1109/TITS.2019.2891235",null,"Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Journal","H","52","522","5223","We present the mapping of a class of simplified air traffic management problems (strategic conflict resolution) to quadratic unconstrained Boolean optimization problems.

NSP seeks the optimal assignment for a set of nurses to shifts under an accompanying set of constraints on schedule and personnel. After reducing NSP to a novel Ising-type Hamiltonian, we evaluate the solution quality obtained from the D-Wave 2000Q against the constraint requirements as well as the diversity of solutions. For the test problems explored here, our results indicate that quantum annealing recovers satisfying solutions for NSP and suggests the heuristic method is potentially achievable for practical use. Moreover, we observe that solution quality can be greatly improved through the use of reverse annealing, in which it is possible to refine returned results by using the annealing process a second time.

This paper proposes a hybrid QC-based deep learning framework for fault diagnosis of electrical power systems that combine the feature extraction capabilities of conditional restricted Boltzmann machine with an efficient classification of deep networks. Computational challenges stemming from the complexities of such deep learning models are overcome by QC-based training methodologies that effectively leverage the complementary strengths of quantum assisted learning and classical training techniques. The proposed hybrid QC-based deep learning framework is tested on a simulated electrical power system with 30 buses and wide variations of substation and transmission line faults, to demonstrate the framework\u2019s applicability, efficiency, and generalization capabilities. High computational efficiency is enjoyed by the proposed hybrid approach in terms of computational effort required and quality of diagnosis performance over classical training methods. In addition, superior and reliable fault diagnosis performance with faster response time is achieved over state-of-the-art pattern recognition methods based on artificial neural networks (ANN) and decision trees (DT).","2021","5/11/2022 15:39","5/15/2022 17:13",null,"117628",null,null,"303",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\D8K5CDWH\\Ajagekar and You - 2021 - Quantum computing based hybrid deep learning for f.pdf",null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","NO","NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.555555556,0.8,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",3.062,null,"Manufacturing","Repair and installation of machinery and equipment","Repair of fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment","Repair of electrical equipment"],["I4392TBW","conferencePaper",2021,"Kuroda, T.; Kuwahara, T.; Yonaga, K.; Osaki, T.; Miyama, M.J.; Ohzeki, M.","Quantum annealing for ICT system design automation",null,695.0,null,null,null,"10.1109/CCGrid51090.2021.00025","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114897752&doi=10.1109%2fCCGrid51090.2021.00025&partnerID=40&md5=592ca6b65adab19df6e16a83ed8ee323","Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Conference","J","62","620","6202",null,"2021","5/11/2022 16:35","5/15/2022 15:32",null,"156-165",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Scopus",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"included",null,null,"Proceedings - 21st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing, CCGrid 2021","YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.555555556,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"A","Information and communication","Computer programming, consultancy and related activities","Computer programming, consultancy and related activities","Computer consultancy and computer facilities management activities"],["GHUSTHSC","bookSection",2020,"Chiscop, Irina; Nauta, Jelle; Veerman, Bert; Phillipson, Frank","A Hybrid Solution Method for the Multi-Service Location Set Covering Problem",null,952.0,"Computational Science \u2013 ICCS 2020",null,null,"10.1007/978-3-030-50433-5_41","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128623258","Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Conference","O","84","841","8413","Abstract The Multi-Service Location Set Covering Problem is an extension of the well-known Set Covering Problem. It arises in practical applications where a set of physical locations need to be equipped with services to satisfy demand within a certain area, while minimizing costs. In this paper we formulate the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, apply the hybrid framework of the D-Wave quantum annealer to solve it, and investigate the feasibility of this approach. To improve the often suboptimal initial solutions found on the D-Wave system, we develop a hybrid quantum/classical optimization algorithm that starts from the seed solution and iteratively creates small subproblems that are more efficiently solved on the D-Wave but often still converge to feasible and improved solutions of the original problem. Finally we suggest some opportunities for increasing the accuracy and performance of our algorithm.","2020","5/11/2022 15:39","5/16/2022 14:41",null,"531-545",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-50433-5_41",null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.666666667,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"A","Public administration and defence;

Inspired by strong non-linear learning capability of support vector regression (SVR), this paper presents an SVR model hybridized with the differential empirical mode decomposition (DEMD) method and quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm (QPSO) for electric load forecasting. The DEMD method is employed to decompose the electric load to several detail parts associated with high frequencies (intrinsic mode function-IMF) and an approximate part associated with low frequencies. Hybridized with quantum theory to enhance particle searching performance, the so-called QPSO is used to optimize the parameters of SVR. The electric load data of the New South Wales (Sydney, Australia) market and the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO, New York, USA) are used for comparing the forecasting performances of different forecasting models. The results illustrate the validity of the idea that the proposed model can simultaneously provide forecasting with good accuracy and interpretability.","2016-03","4/11/2022 15:14","5/12/2022 16:15",null,"221 (20 pp.)",null,"3","9",null,"Energies",null,"Energies (Switzerland)",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Place: Switzerland Publisher: MDPI AG",null,"; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\S9Y5ZW9B\\Li-Ling Peng et al. - 2016 - Hybridizing DEMD and Quantum PSO with SVR in Elect.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en9030221","regression analysis; load forecasting; particle swarm optimisation; support vector machines; included; reverse snowball; forward snowball",null,null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.75,0.866666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",0.662,null,"Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution"],["KQ92FIRT","journalArticle",2020,"Ruidas, Subhendu; Seikh, Mijanur Rahaman; Nayak, Prasun Kumar","An EPQ model with stock and selling price dependent demand and variable production rate in interval environment",19700177002.0,null,"International Journal of Systems Assurance Engineering and Management",null,"09756809","10.1007/s13198-019-00867-w",null,"Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","C","15","151","1512","The motto of this paper is to develop a production inventory model in real life situation. In reality, demand of a certain product becomes highly effected by on-hand stock level in stores and the selling price of the product. In the proposed model, demand of the product is dependent on these two vital deceive factors. In real life production systems, always there are some defective products which requires reworking in order to make them useful. The possibility of producing some defective items in regular production process and their reworking has been taken into account in the model. In case of inventories of highly demandable products, it is observed that production rate is proportional to demand. The situation also arises in case of launching a new product or in a multi-stage production system. In this model, production rate is a variable and it varies with the demand rate. Shortages are allowed and it is backlogged fully. Based on these assumptions, several researchers worked on but they considered that the associated inventory cost parameters are fixed real numbers. However, these are not fixed in reality and may vary time to time depending upon some scenario. Main objective of the paper is to develop a production inventory model under those assumptions considering various cost parameters as interval numbers. As a result the corresponding optimization problem is also interval valued. Quantum behaved particle swarm optimization technique has been applied to find the maximum profit in a single cycle. Numerical example and sensitivity analysis are given to illustrate the proposed inventory model.  2019, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.","2020","4/11/2022 15:14","5/4/2022 11:23",null,"385-399",null,"2","11",null,"International Journal of Systems Assurance Engineering and Management",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Publisher: Springer",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\TY5WT3EX\\Ruidas et al. - 2020 - An EPQ model with stock and selling price dependen.pdf;

Therefore, iterative optimization based on its strict mechanism model will be much time-consuming. In order to reduce the computational cost, a process optimization method for the coagulation process of carbon liber precursor spinning based on surrogate model was proposed. Using meta-modeling technology, this paper constructs the surrogate model which describes the relationship between the key operating parameters and the main output variables in the coagulation process. In the process of constructing the surrogate model, an evolutionary optimal sample point insertion criterion is adopted to improve the accuracy of the model. And the quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is applied for searching operating parameters in the design space.

Thus, in order to efficiently resolve this problem, the multi-objective quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (MOQPSO) is presented in this paper.

Furthermore, the proposed hybrid algorithm is proposed for solving load flow problems with considering the reactive limits at generation buses.

Emissions of CO2, SO2, and NOx are considered 3 different objectives, thus making it a 4-objective problem considering ED. Many-objective EED problems are defined by using a cubic criterion function, and a max/max price penalty factor is considered to convert all the objectives into a single objective to compare the final results with other well-known methods found in the literature like Lagrangian relaxation, particle swarm optimization, simulated annealing, and quantum-behaved bat algorithm. Quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization is implemented on a 6-unit system to solve many-objective EED problems, and at the same time, to show the effectiveness of QPSO in large systems, it is also implemented in a 26-unit power generation system for ED problem.

Now, one major drawback of the available models is that they consider the amount of carbon emission associated with various inventory processes like setup process, production process, inventory holding process, etc. as fixed numbers. However, these quantities may not be fixed in reality due to several factors, like the condition of the carbon filtrating apparatus in the production firm, machine breakdown, quality of the raw material, nature of the fuel or energy used, etc. The parameters may vary in between some certain ranges. This paper aims at developing an imperfect production inventory model under the various carbon emission regulatory policies where the various carbon emission parameters are interval numbers. The various inventory cost parameters are also represented as interval numbers to reflect the practical situation. The demand of the product is assumed to be a linearly decreasing function of the selling price of the product. Also, the idea of a new inventory cost component, referred to as the \u2018development cost\u2019 is introduced. Four different policies- simple tax policy, cap and purchase policy, cap and reward policy and strictly under permitted cap policy are discussed, and based on those policies four different inventory models are developed. The Quantum behaved Particle Swarm Optimization(QPSO) algorithm has been applied to find the optimal profit of the manufacturer. The optimal profit obtained here is also an interval number which is quite realistic. The traditional fuzzy or probabilistic approach to represent impreciseness fails to find such kind of solution. A numerical example for every case has been given to illustrate the applicability of the models. Finally, sensitivity analysis of the optimal feasible solution due to variation in some key parameters has been provided with the key managerial insights.","2021-04-01","5/4/2022 11:21","5/18/2022 11:46","5/4/2022 11:21","107154",null,null,"154",null,"Computers & Industrial Engineering",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"en",null,null,null,null,"ScienceDirect",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\ISRLT4XK\\Ruidas et al. - 2021 - A production inventory model with interval-valued .pdf",null,"included","Sustainable production;

Focusing on this problem, this paper has carried out a study on the multi-objective configuration optimization method (COM) and energy management strategy (EMS) for ship hybrid energy systems based on quantum computing. First, the mathematical model of distributed power modules of the hybrid energy system is established, and a configuration optimization objective function that aims at low-cost, long equipment life, and high reliability of power supply is constructed. Then, the combination with fuzzy rules and quantum multi-objective artificial bee colony algorithm to solve the objective function, the configuration scheme satisfying multiple constraints is obtained. On this basis, an energy management optimization objective function that meets both low-cost operation and maximum clean energy utilization for ship electric power system is established, an objective function is optimized in multi-objective quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm, the real-time optimal scheduling for hybrid energy systems of the ship is realized. Experiments on actual navigation data verify the feasibility of the multi-objective configuration optimization method using the quantum artificial bee colony (QABC) algorithm. Furthermore, energy management experiments using different strategies, experimental results show that the energy management strategy proposed in this paper outperforms other methods, effectively reduces the operating costs, fuel costs, and pollutant emissions of marine power system, meet the environmental requirements of the Energy Efficiency Operating Index (EEOI) for ships.","2022","5/11/2022 15:23","5/12/2022 23:07",null,"124131",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\Y4Z27BYU\\Si et al. - 2022 - Configuration optimization and energy management o.pdf",null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.75,0.733333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Not assigned","Not assigned",null,"Manufacturing","Manufacture of electrical equipment","Manufacture of electric motors, generators, transformers and electricity distribution and control apparatus","Manufacture of electric motors, generators, transformers and electricity distribution and control apparatus"],["AG8T9SYN","journalArticle",2021,"Ren, F.; Feng, W.","Homotopy-SQP coupled method for optimal control of far-distance nonplanar rapid cooperative rendezvous with multiple specific-direction thrusts",12375.0,null,"Advances in Space Research",null,null,"10.1016/j.asr.2021.06.019","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108534059&doi=10.1016%2fj.asr.2021.06.019&partnerID=40&md5=d0f1f164de3e477f78bbf3106d628f2c","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","H","52","522","5229",null,"2021","5/11/2022 16:08","5/13/2022 22:17",null,"3176-3190",null,"8","68",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Scopus",null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\AMEIJWDS\\Ren and Feng - 2021 - Homotopy-SQP coupled method for optimal control of.pdf; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\F9QSFPRB\\S0273117721004890.html",null,"included","Optimal control; Cooperative rendezvous; Multiple specific-direction thrusts; Indirect method; Intelligent algorithm",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","NO","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.555555556,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q2",0.613,null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Other transportation support activities"],["KPLNY54V","journalArticle",2021,"Ren, Fei","Optimization for Far-distance Cooperative Rendezvous with Multiple Direction-fixed Thrusts",130053.0,null,"Journal of Physics: Conference Series",null,null,"10.1088/1742-6596/2068/1/012021","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142466149","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","H","52","522","5229","The continuous-thrust far-distance cooperative rendezvous problem between two spacecraft is investigated. The indirect optimization method, based on Pontryagin\u2019s maximum principle (PMP), is applied to optimize fuel consumption. To overcome the difficulty in nonsmooth integration caused by the bang-bang control, the homotopy method is adopted to solve the fuel-optimal problem from a related energy-optimal problem. The quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is used to obtain the energy-optimal solutions. The energy-optimal solutions are used as the initial values for the homotopic procedure to obtain the fuel-optimal solutions and optimal bang-bang control law. A hybrid algorithm combined homotopy method and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm is proposed. This hybrid algorithm can effectively obtain feasible optimal solutions even though the indirect optimization method exhibits a narrow convergence domain. Simulations of high-thrust and low-thrust rendezvous problems are provided and the proposed hybrid algorithm is verified.

Given an initially clustered formation, a configuration, based on satellite coverage requirements, is set as the final configuration which the cluster aims to achieve, with minimal fuel consumption. Results show that QPSO had a better performance compared to traditional PSO, yielding faster convergence, higher accuracy, as well as better reliability to evade local minima by exploring a wider search spread.","2021","5/11/2022 16:12","5/13/2022 21:52",null,"379-389",null,null,null,null,null,null,"Lecture Notes in Computer Science",null,null,null,"Springer International Publishing","Cham","en",null,null,null,null,"Springer Link",null,null,null,null,null,"included","Optimization; PSO; Lambert theorem; Quantum PSO; Satellite formation reconfiguration","Rutkowski, Leszek; Scherer, Rafa\u0142; Korytkowski, Marcin; Pedrycz, Witold; Tadeusiewicz, Ryszard; Zurada, Jacek M.",null,"YES","NO","NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.444444444,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"National: Poland","Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Other transportation support activities"],["77GKKSBZ","journalArticle",2020,"Wang, Z.; Dong, Y.; Feng, W.; Zhao, J.","Optimization for far-distance and fuel-limited cooperative rendezvous between two coplanar spacecraft based on Lambert method",29080.0,null,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part G: Journal of Aerospace Engineering",null,null,"10.1177/0954410019900447","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078786399&doi=10.1177%2f0954410019900447&partnerID=40&md5=2011645b471493affc083906f90c706e","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","H","52","522","5229",null,"2020","5/11/2022 16:08","5/15/2022 18:52",null,"1301-1310",null,"7","234",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Scopus",null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\VP83G3W6\\Wang et al. - 2020 - Optimization for far-distance and fuel-limited coo.pdf",null,"included","quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization; Cooperative rendezvous; far-distance orbit maneuver; Lambert's problem; sequential quadratic programming; trajectory optimization",null,null,"NO",null,"NO","YES",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.375,0.642857143,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q2",0.39,null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Other transportation support activities"],["WNGS4R5C","journalArticle",2020,"Yu, G.; Zhao, Y.; Cui, Z.; Zuo, Y.","A QPSO algorithm based on hierarchical weight and its application in cloud computing task scheduling",19300157037.0,null,"Computer Science and Information Systems",null,null,"10.2298/CSIS200223033Y","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100571358&doi=10.2298%2fCSIS200223033Y&partnerID=40&md5=8b8318ec52e94c55d7d587207c3deb69","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","J","63","631","6311",null,"2020","5/11/2022 15:03","5/15/2022 17:27",null,"189-212",null,"1","18",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Scopus",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","NO","NO","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.555555556,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q3",0.244,null,"Information and communication","Information service activities","Data processing, hosting and related activities; web portals","Data processing, hosting and related activities"],["HJULMHY8","conferencePaper",2021,"Pang, Tailai; Song, Yujuan; Zhu, Daqi","Task allocation for multi-AUV system under ocean current environment",null,null,"2021 China Automation Congress (CAC)",null,null,"10.1109/CAC53003.2021.9727785",null,"Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Conference","M","71","711","7110","The task allocation of multi-autonomous underwater vehicle systems (MAUVs) is how to allocate tasks to appropriate AUVs under certain constraints.

In this paper we propose to leverage their capabilities to address an important task for recommender systems providers, the optimal selection of recommendation carousels. In many video-on-demand and music streaming services the user is provided with a homepage containing several recommendation lists, i.e., carousels, each built with a certain criteria (e.g., artist, mood, Action movies etc.). Choosing which set of carousels to display is a difficult problem because it needs to account for how the different recommendation lists interact, e.g., avoiding duplicate recommendations, and how they help the user explore the catalogue. We focus in particular on the adiabatic computing paradigm and use the D-Wave quantum annealer, which is able to solve NP-hard optimization problems, can be programmed by classical operations research tools and is freely available on the cloud. We propose a formulation of the carousel selection problem for black box recommenders, that can be solved effectively on a quantum annealer and has the advantage of being simple.

Among others, an important goal is the minimization of the total transit time of the passengers. The corresponding objective function is quadratic in the binary decision variables encoding the flight-to-gate assignment. Hence, it is a quadratic assignment problem being hard to solve in general. In this work we investigate the solvability of this problem with a D-Wave quantum annealer. These machines are optimizers for quadratic unconstrained optimization problems (QUBO). Therefore the flight gate assignment problem seems to be well suited for these machines. We use real world data from a mid-sized German airport as well as simulation based data to extract typical instances small enough to be amenable to the D-Wave machine. In order to mitigate precision problems, we employ bin packing on the passenger numbers to reduce the precision requirements of the extracted instances. We find that, for the instances we investigated, the bin packing has little effect on the solution quality. Hence, we were able to solve small problem instances extracted from real data with the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer.","2019","4/25/2022 14:01","5/13/2022 22:04",null,"99-110",null,null,null,null,null,null,"Lecture Notes in Computer Science",null,null,null,"Springer International Publishing","Cham","en",null,null,null,null,"Springer Link",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\2MYGAWJY\\Stollenwerk et al. - 2019 - Flight Gate Assignment with a Quantum Annealer.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball","Quantum annealing; Airport planning; Quadratic assignment problem; QUBO","Feld, Sebastian; Linnhoff-Popien, Claudia",null,"NO",null,"YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES",null,"NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.571428571,0.642857143,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Service activities incidental to air transportation"],["VC9K5BV6","journalArticle",2020,"Stollenwerk, Tobias; O\u2019Gorman, Bryan; Venturelli, Davide; Mandr\u00e0, Salvatore; Rodionova, Olga; Ng, Hokkwan; Sridhar, Banavar; Rieffel, Eleanor Gilbert; Biswas, Rupak","Quantum Annealing Applied to De-Conflicting Optimal Trajectories for Air Traffic Management",18378.0,null,"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems",null,"1558-0016","10.1109/TITS.2019.2891235",null,"Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Journal","H","52","522","5223","We present the mapping of a class of simplified air traffic management problems (strategic conflict resolution) to quadratic unconstrained Boolean optimization problems.

The representation allows a natural decomposition of a real-world instance related to wind-optimal trajectories over the Atlantic Ocean into smaller subproblems that can be discretized and are amenable to be programmed in quantum annealers. In this paper, we tested the new programming techniques, and we benchmark the hardness of the instances using both classical solvers and the D-Wave 2X and D-Wave 2000Q quantum chip.

In Asia, the traffic situation can be further deteriorated by road sharing of scooters. How to control the traffic flow to mitigate the congestion has been one of the central issues in transportation research. In this study, we employ a quantum annealing approach to optimize the traffic signals control at a real-life intersection with mixed traffic flows of vehicles and scooters. Considering traffic flow is a continuous and emerging phenomenon, we used quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formalism for traffic optimization, which has a natural equivalence to the Ising model and can be solved efficiently on the quantum annealers, quantum computers or digital annealers. In this article, we first applied the QUBO traffic optimization to artificially generated traffic for a simple intersection, and then we used real-time traffic data to simulate a real \"Dongda-Keyuan\" intersection with dedicated cars and scooter lanes, as well as mixed scooter and car lanes. We introduced two types of traffic light control systems for traffic optimization: C-QUBO and QUBO. Our rigorous QUBO optimizations show that C-QUBO and QUBO outperform the commonly used fixed cycle method, with QUBO outperforming C-QUBO in some instances. It has been found that QUBO optimization significantly relieves traffic congestion for the unbalanced traffic volume. Furthermore, we found that dynamic changes in traffic light signal duration greatly reduce traffic congestion.","2021-11","5/3/2022 15:49","5/13/2022 22:06",null,"74-81",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"ISSN: 2693-8421",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\S84X95F3\\9704985.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\L2YQSACW\\9704985.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\3ZULA6CL\\Singh et al. - 2021 - Quantum Annealing Approach for the Optimal Real-ti.pdf",null,"included","Annealing; Quantum annealing; Urban areas; Motorcycles; Real-time systems; quantum computing; quantum annealing; Correlation; QUBO; real-time optimization; Roads; traffic optimization; traffic signal control",null,"2021 IEEE/ACIS 22nd International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD)","YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.75,0.8,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"C","Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Other transportation support activities"],["GPT28I5I","conferencePaper",2019,"James, Scott Howard; Raheb, Robert Nicholas","Path Planning for Critical ATM/UTM Areas",null,null,"2019 IEEE/AIAA 38th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)",null,null,"10.1109/DASC43569.2019.9081662",null,"Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization",null,null,"Conference","H","52","522","5223","We create a path planning algorithm to be used in areas where conventional aircraft and Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAV) are in close proximity.

NSP seeks the optimal assignment for a set of nurses to shifts under an accompanying set of constraints on schedule and personnel. After reducing NSP to a novel Ising-type Hamiltonian, we evaluate the solution quality obtained from the D-Wave 2000Q against the constraint requirements as well as the diversity of solutions. For the test problems explored here, our results indicate that quantum annealing recovers satisfying solutions for NSP and suggests the heuristic method is potentially achievable for practical use. Moreover, we observe that solution quality can be greatly improved through the use of reverse annealing, in which it is possible to refine returned results by using the annealing process a second time.

It arises in practical applications where a set of physical locations need to be equipped with services to satisfy demand within a certain area, while minimizing costs. In this paper we formulate the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, apply the hybrid framework of the D-Wave quantum annealer to solve it, and investigate the feasibility of this approach. To improve the often suboptimal initial solutions found on the D-Wave system, we develop a hybrid quantum/classical optimization algorithm that starts from the seed solution and iteratively creates small subproblems that are more efficiently solved on the D-Wave but often still converge to feasible and improved solutions of the original problem. Finally we suggest some opportunities for increasing the accuracy and performance of our algorithm.","2020","5/11/2022 15:39","5/16/2022 14:41",null,"531-545",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-50433-5_41",null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.666666667,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"A","Public administration and defence;

In this model, the wavelet packet decomposition method is used to reasonably decompose the high-frequency fluctuation and low-frequency fluctuation of renewable energy to achieve the function of stabilizing fluctuation. Meanwhile, an operation strategy for hybrid energy storage to participate in demand response is proposed. Rain flow counting method is used to research the life of hybrid energy storage system, which improves the accuracy of energy storage annual cost calculation. In the Simulation and Analysis section, the genetic quantum algorithm is used for simulation and analysis of the role and benefits of hybrid energy storage.

A hybrid QIEA is presented for multiple knapsack problem which incorporates several features for better balance between exploration and exploitation. The proposed QIEA, dubbed QIEA-MKP, provides significantly improved performance over simple QIEA from both the perspectives viz., the quality of solutions and computational effort required to reach the best solution.

Most often software product developments are iterative and incremental in their nature, due to the changes in the customer requirements from time to time. It is a challenging task to select the requirements from a large number of candidates, for the accomplishment of the business goals. The problem is to identify a set of requirements to be included in the next release of the product, by minimizing the cost and maximizing the customer satisfaction. Since minimizing the total cost and maximizing the customer satisfaction are contradictory objectives, the problem has a multi-objective nature. This problem is NP-hard in its nature and so it cannot be solved efficiently by using traditional optimization techniques for large problem instances. QEMEA combines the best features of Evolutionary Algorithms and Quantum Computing. It employs the concepts of Quantum computing such as superposition and interference.

Rational gate allocation is regarded as one of the most important means to solve this bottleneck. In this paper, in order to comprehensively considere different stakeholders, a three-objective gate allocation model is to consider a wider scope, in which the minimizing passenger walking distances, the most balanced idle time of each gate and the best full use of large gate are optimized simultaneously to improve the practical efficiency. To efficiently solve this model, an improved quantum evolutionary algorithm (QEA) based on the niche co-evolution strategy and enhanced particle swarm optimization (PSO), namely IPOQEA is designed. An IPOQEA-based gate allocation method is proposed to allocate the flights to suitable gates within different periods. Finally, the actual operation data of Baiyun Airport is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Comparison results show that the constructed model can address the passenger walking distances, robustness and costs in airport management. Moreover, the IPOQEA has better optimization ability in solving gate allocation problem. Therefore, the proposed gate allocation method has great potential for practical engineering since it can easily make decisions for airport managers.","2022-03","5/4/2022 10:25","5/13/2022 21:03",null,"1737-1745",null,"3","23",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\SD597D35\\9210735.html;

The analyses suggest that the good solutions are clustered in the search space and there is a correlation between the \ufb01tness of a local optimum and its distance to the best solution. Inspired by these \ufb01ndings, a new operator for Quantum Evolutionary Algorithms is proposed which, during the search process, collects information about the \ufb01tness landscape and tried to capture the backbone structure of the landscape. The knowledge it has collected is used to guide the search process towards a better region in the search space. The proposed algorithm consists of two phases. The \ufb01rst phase uses a tabu mechanism to collect information about the \ufb01tness landscape. In the second phase, the collected data are processed to guide the algorithm towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm clusters the good solutions it has found in its previous search process. Then when the population is converged and trapped in a local optimum, it is divided into sub-populations and each sub-population is designated to a cluster. The information in the database is then used to reinitialize the q-individuals, so they represent better regions in the search space. This way the population maintains diversity and by capturing the \ufb01tness landscape structure, the algorithm is guided towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm is compared with some state-ofthe-art algorithms from PATAT competition conferences and experimental results are presented.","2021-04","5/4/2022 14:30","5/13/2022 22:40","5/4/2022 14:30","114211",null,null,"168",null,"Expert Systems with Applications","How to exploit fitness landscape properties of timetabling problem",null,null,null,null,null,null,"en",null,null,null,null,"DOI.org (Crossref)",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\AKDUX97Q\\Najaran - 2021 - How to exploit fitness landscape properties of tim.pdf",null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.875,0.6,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",2.07,null,"Professional, scientific and technical activities","Activities of head offices; management consultancy activities","Activities of head offices","Activities of head offices"]],"hovertemplate":"<b>S<sub>S</sub>: %{x}</b><br>S<sub>R</sub>: %{customdata[82]}<br>DOI: %{customdata[10]}","marker":{"outliercolor":"black"},"meanline":{"color":"black","visible":true},"name":"Quantum-inspired Evolutionary Algorithm","points":"all","x":[0.555555556,0.625,0.375,0.875,0.75,0.666666667,0.777777778,0.666666667,0.666666667,0.875],"type":"violin"}],                        {"template":{"data":{"pie":[{"automargin":true,"type":"pie"}]},"layout":{"xaxis":{"showgrid":true,"title":{"standoff":15}},"yaxis":{"showgrid":true,"title":{"standoff":15}}}},"xaxis":{"range":[0,1],"title":{"text":"$S_S$"}},"yaxis":{"title":{"text":"Algorithm Name"}},"margin":{"l":300},"showlegend":false},                        {"responsive": true}                    )                };                            </script>        </div></div>

In this paper we propose to leverage their capabilities to address an important task for recommender systems providers, the optimal selection of recommendation carousels. In many video-on-demand and music streaming services the user is provided with a homepage containing several recommendation lists, i.e., carousels, each built with a certain criteria (e.g., artist, mood, Action movies etc.). Choosing which set of carousels to display is a difficult problem because it needs to account for how the different recommendation lists interact, e.g., avoiding duplicate recommendations, and how they help the user explore the catalogue. We focus in particular on the adiabatic computing paradigm and use the D-Wave quantum annealer, which is able to solve NP-hard optimization problems, can be programmed by classical operations research tools and is freely available on the cloud.

Therefore the flight gate assignment problem seems to be well suited for these machines. We use real world data from a mid-sized German airport as well as simulation based data to extract typical instances small enough to be amenable to the D-Wave machine. In order to mitigate precision problems, we employ bin packing on the passenger numbers to reduce the precision requirements of the extracted instances. We find that, for the instances we investigated, the bin packing has little effect on the solution quality. Hence, we were able to solve small problem instances extracted from real data with the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer.","2019","4/25/2022 14:01","5/13/2022 22:04",null,"99-110",null,null,null,null,null,null,"Lecture Notes in Computer Science",null,null,null,"Springer International Publishing","Cham","en",null,null,null,null,"Springer Link",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\2MYGAWJY\\Stollenwerk et al. - 2019 - Flight Gate Assignment with a Quantum Annealer.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball","Quantum annealing; Airport planning; Quadratic assignment problem; QUBO","Feld, Sebastian; Linnhoff-Popien, Claudia",null,"NO",null,"YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES",null,"NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.571428571,0.642857143,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Service activities incidental to air transportation"],["VC9K5BV6","journalArticle",2020,"Stollenwerk, Tobias; O\u2019Gorman, Bryan; Venturelli, Davide; Mandr\u00e0, Salvatore; Rodionova, Olga; Ng, Hokkwan; Sridhar, Banavar; Rieffel, Eleanor Gilbert; Biswas, Rupak","Quantum Annealing Applied to De-Conflicting Optimal Trajectories for Air Traffic Management",18378.0,null,"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems",null,"1558-0016","10.1109/TITS.2019.2891235",null,"Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Journal","H","52","522","5223","We present the mapping of a class of simplified air traffic management problems (strategic conflict resolution) to quadratic unconstrained Boolean optimization problems.

The representation allows a natural decomposition of a real-world instance related to wind-optimal trajectories over the Atlantic Ocean into smaller subproblems that can be discretized and are amenable to be programmed in quantum annealers. In this paper, we tested the new programming techniques, and we benchmark the hardness of the instances using both classical solvers and the D-Wave 2X and D-Wave 2000Q quantum chip.

NSP seeks the optimal assignment for a set of nurses to shifts under an accompanying set of constraints on schedule and personnel. After reducing NSP to a novel Ising-type Hamiltonian, we evaluate the solution quality obtained from the D-Wave 2000Q against the constraint requirements as well as the diversity of solutions. For the test problems explored here, our results indicate that quantum annealing recovers satisfying solutions for NSP and suggests the heuristic method is potentially achievable for practical use. Moreover, we observe that solution quality can be greatly improved through the use of reverse annealing, in which it is possible to refine returned results by using the annealing process a second time. We compare the performance of NSP using both forward and reverse annealing methods and describe how this approach might be used in practice.","2019","5/4/2022 10:49","5/16/2022 16:18",null,"12837",null,"1","9",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.555555556,0.733333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",1.341,null,"Human health and social work activities","Human health activities","Hospital activities","Hospital activities"],["MXVUMVPM","conferencePaper",2021,"Henderson, Jessie M.; O\u2019Malley, Daniel; Viswanathan, Hari S.","Interrogating the performance of quantum annealing for the solution of steady-state subsurface flow",null,null,"2021 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)",null,null,"10.1109/HPEC49654.2021.9622819",null,"Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Conference","E","36","360","3600","In the 1990s, the principles of quantum mechanics were leveraged to describe how discrete combinatorial optimization problems could be solved using a method called quantum annealing.

To improve the often suboptimal initial solutions found on the D-Wave system, we develop a hybrid quantum/classical optimization algorithm that starts from the seed solution and iteratively creates small subproblems that are more efficiently solved on the D-Wave but often still converge to feasible and improved solutions of the original problem.

It was only recently that small but functional quantum computers have become available on the cloud, allowing to test their potential. In this paper we propose to leverage their capabilities to address an important task for recommender systems providers, the optimal selection of recommendation carousels. In many video-on-demand and music streaming services the user is provided with a homepage containing several recommendation lists, i.e., carousels, each built with a certain criteria (e.g., artist, mood, Action movies etc.). Choosing which set of carousels to display is a difficult problem because it needs to account for how the different recommendation lists interact, e.g., avoiding duplicate recommendations, and how they help the user explore the catalogue. We focus in particular on the adiabatic computing paradigm and use the D-Wave quantum annealer, which is able to solve NP-hard optimization problems, can be programmed by classical operations research tools and is freely available on the cloud. We propose a formulation of the carousel selection problem for black box recommenders, that can be solved effectively on a quantum annealer and has the advantage of being simple. We discuss its effectiveness, limitations and possible future directions of development.  2021 Owner/Author.","2021","4/11/2022 15:14","5/13/2022 22:04",null,"691-696",null,null,null,null,null,null,"RecSys 2021 - 15th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems",null,null,null,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","Virtual, Online, Netherlands",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\B9BIPMP8\\Ferrari Dacrema et al. - 2021 - Optimizing the selection of recommendation carouse.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3460231.3478853","Optimization; Annealing; Quantum computers; Recommender systems; Operations research; User interfaces; Video on demand; included; reverse snowball; forward snowball",null,null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","NO",null,"NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",0.714285714,0.866666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"A","Information and communication","Information service activities","Data processing, hosting and related activities; web portals","Data processing, hosting and related activities"],["KKR576SB","journalArticle",2017,"Neukart, Florian; Compostella, Gabriele; Seidel, Christian; von Dollen, David; Yarkoni, Sheir; Parney, Bob","Traffic Flow Optimization Using a Quantum Annealer",21100893766.0,null,"Frontiers in ICT",null,"2297-198X","10.3389/fict.2017.00029","https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fict.2017.00029","Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Journal","H","52","522","5229","Quantum annealing algorithms belong to the class of metaheuristic tools, applicable for solving binary optimization problems. Hardware implementations of quantum annealing, such as the quantum processing units (QPUs) produced by D-Wave Systems, have been subject to multiple analyses in research, with the aim of characterizing the technology\u2019s usefulness for optimization and sampling tasks. In this paper, we present a real-world application that uses quantum technologies. Specifically, we show how to map certain parts of a real-world traffic flow optimization problem to be suitable for quantum annealing. We show that time-critical optimization tasks, such as continuous redistribution of position data for cars in dense road networks, are suitable candidates for quantum computing. Due to the limited size and connectivity of current-generation D-Wave QPUs, we use a hybrid quantum and classical approach to solve the traffic flow problem.","2017","4/24/2022 18:26","5/13/2022 22:04","4/24/2022 18:26",null,null,null,"4",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Frontiers",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\CTK8HSJK\\Neukart et al. - 2017 - Traffic Flow Optimization Using a Quantum Annealer.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball",null,null,null,"YES","NO","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.625,0.733333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Not assigned","Not assigned",null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Other transportation support activities"],["N4AXE29P","journalArticle",2019,"Ohzeki, Masayuki; Miki, Akira; Miyama, Masamichi J.; Terabe, Masayoshi","Control of Automated Guided Vehicles Without Collision by Quantum Annealer and Digital Devices",null,null,"Frontiers in Computer Science",null,"2624-9898","10.3389/fcomp.2019.00009","https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fcomp.2019.00009","Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Journal","H","52","522","5229","Recent advance on quantum devices realizes an artificial quantum spin system known as the D-Wave 2000Q, which implements the Ising model with tunable transverse field.

However the resulting spin configurations are not always in the ground state. It can rather quickly generate many spin configurations following the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution. In the present study, we formulate an Ising model to control a large number of automated guided vehicles in a factory without collision.

In this work we investigate the solvability of this problem with a D-Wave quantum annealer. These machines are optimizers for quadratic unconstrained optimization problems (QUBO). Therefore the flight gate assignment problem seems to be well suited for these machines. We use real world data from a mid-sized German airport as well as simulation based data to extract typical instances small enough to be amenable to the D-Wave machine. In order to mitigate precision problems, we employ bin packing on the passenger numbers to reduce the precision requirements of the extracted instances. We find that, for the instances we investigated, the bin packing has little effect on the solution quality.

NSP seeks the optimal assignment for a set of nurses to shifts under an accompanying set of constraints on schedule and personnel. After reducing NSP to a novel Ising-type Hamiltonian, we evaluate the solution quality obtained from the D-Wave 2000Q against the constraint requirements as well as the diversity of solutions. For the test problems explored here, our results indicate that quantum annealing recovers satisfying solutions for NSP and suggests the heuristic method is potentially achievable for practical use. Moreover, we observe that solution quality can be greatly improved through the use of reverse annealing, in which it is possible to refine returned results by using the annealing process a second time.

This paper proposes a hybrid QC-based deep learning framework for fault diagnosis of electrical power systems that combine the feature extraction capabilities of conditional restricted Boltzmann machine with an efficient classification of deep networks. Computational challenges stemming from the complexities of such deep learning models are overcome by QC-based training methodologies that effectively leverage the complementary strengths of quantum assisted learning and classical training techniques. The proposed hybrid QC-based deep learning framework is tested on a simulated electrical power system with 30 buses and wide variations of substation and transmission line faults, to demonstrate the framework\u2019s applicability, efficiency, and generalization capabilities. High computational efficiency is enjoyed by the proposed hybrid approach in terms of computational effort required and quality of diagnosis performance over classical training methods. In addition, superior and reliable fault diagnosis performance with faster response time is achieved over state-of-the-art pattern recognition methods based on artificial neural networks (ANN) and decision trees (DT).","2021","5/11/2022 15:39","5/15/2022 17:13",null,"117628",null,null,"303",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\D8K5CDWH\\Ajagekar and You - 2021 - Quantum computing based hybrid deep learning for f.pdf",null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","NO","NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.555555556,0.8,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",3.062,null,"Manufacturing","Repair and installation of machinery and equipment","Repair of fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment","Repair of electrical equipment"],["I4392TBW","conferencePaper",2021,"Kuroda, T.; Kuwahara, T.; Yonaga, K.; Osaki, T.; Miyama, M.J.; Ohzeki, M.","Quantum annealing for ICT system design automation",null,695.0,null,null,null,"10.1109/CCGrid51090.2021.00025","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114897752&doi=10.1109%2fCCGrid51090.2021.00025&partnerID=40&md5=592ca6b65adab19df6e16a83ed8ee323","Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Conference","J","62","620","6202",null,"2021","5/11/2022 16:35","5/15/2022 15:32",null,"156-165",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Scopus",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"included",null,null,"Proceedings - 21st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing, CCGrid 2021","YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.555555556,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"A","Information and communication","Computer programming, consultancy and related activities","Computer programming, consultancy and related activities","Computer consultancy and computer facilities management activities"],["GHUSTHSC","bookSection",2020,"Chiscop, Irina; Nauta, Jelle; Veerman, Bert; Phillipson, Frank","A Hybrid Solution Method for the Multi-Service Location Set Covering Problem",null,952.0,"Computational Science \u2013 ICCS 2020",null,null,"10.1007/978-3-030-50433-5_41","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128623258","Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Conference","O","84","841","8413","Abstract The Multi-Service Location Set Covering Problem is an extension of the well-known Set Covering Problem. It arises in practical applications where a set of physical locations need to be equipped with services to satisfy demand within a certain area, while minimizing costs. In this paper we formulate the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, apply the hybrid framework of the D-Wave quantum annealer to solve it, and investigate the feasibility of this approach. To improve the often suboptimal initial solutions found on the D-Wave system, we develop a hybrid quantum/classical optimization algorithm that starts from the seed solution and iteratively creates small subproblems that are more efficiently solved on the D-Wave but often still converge to feasible and improved solutions of the original problem. Finally we suggest some opportunities for increasing the accuracy and performance of our algorithm.","2020","5/11/2022 15:39","5/16/2022 14:41",null,"531-545",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-50433-5_41",null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.666666667,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"A","Public administration and defence;

In reality, demand of a certain product becomes highly effected by on-hand stock level in stores and the selling price of the product. In the proposed model, demand of the product is dependent on these two vital deceive factors. In real life production systems, always there are some defective products which requires reworking in order to make them useful. The possibility of producing some defective items in regular production process and their reworking has been taken into account in the model. In case of inventories of highly demandable products, it is observed that production rate is proportional to demand. The situation also arises in case of launching a new product or in a multi-stage production system. In this model, production rate is a variable and it varies with the demand rate. Shortages are allowed and it is backlogged fully. Based on these assumptions, several researchers worked on but they considered that the associated inventory cost parameters are fixed real numbers. However, these are not fixed in reality and may vary time to time depending upon some scenario. Main objective of the paper is to develop a production inventory model under those assumptions considering various cost parameters as interval numbers. As a result the corresponding optimization problem is also interval valued. Quantum behaved particle swarm optimization technique has been applied to find the maximum profit in a single cycle. Numerical example and sensitivity analysis are given to illustrate the proposed inventory model.  2019, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.","2020","4/11/2022 15:14","5/4/2022 11:23",null,"385-399",null,"2","11",null,"International Journal of Systems Assurance Engineering and Management",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Publisher: Springer",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\TY5WT3EX\\Ruidas et al. - 2020 - An EPQ model with stock and selling price dependen.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13198-019-00867-w","Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Numerical methods; Sensitivity analysis; Inventory control; Defects; included; reverse snowball; forward snowball",null,null,null,"NO",null,"NO","YES",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.25,0.857142857,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q3",0.3,null,"Manufacturing","Manufacture of leather and related products","Tanning and dressing of leather; manufacture of luggage, handbags, saddlery and harness; dressing and dyeing of fur","Manufacture of luggage, handbags and the like, saddlery and harness"],["S7PQWZ65","conferencePaper",2018,"Zhang, Y.; Lyden, S.; De La Barra, B.A.L.; Haque, M.E.","Optimization of Tremblay's battery model parameters for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle applications",null,null,null,null,null,"10.1109/AUPEC.2017.8282405","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050917674&doi=10.1109%2fAUPEC.2017.8282405&partnerID=40&md5=b21f7e69bb78699deeb9f376bdd9e4f5","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Conference","C","27","272","2720",null,"2018","4/11/2022 15:15","5/11/2022 16:18",null,"1-6",null,null,"2017-November",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Scopus",null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\AGZQ94JW\\Zhang et al. - 2018 - Optimization of Tremblay's battery model parameter.pdf",null,"included; reverse snowball; forward snowball",null,null,"2017 Australasian Universities Power Engineering Conference, AUPEC 2017","YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.75,0.6,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"Not assigned","Manufacturing","Manufacture of electrical equipment","Manufacture of batteries and accumulators","Manufacture of batteries and accumulators"],["ITNK88F2","conferencePaper",2020,"Sheng, Jiangfan; Kong, Weijian; Qi, Jie","Process optimization of carbon fiber precursor spinning coagulation process based on surrogate model",null,null,"2020 Chinese Automation Congress (CAC)",null,null,"10.1109/CAC51589.2020.9326779",null,"Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Conference","C","23","239","2399","High-quality carbon fiber precursor is the key to the manufacture of high-performance carbon fiber, and the coagulation process is one of the key steps in the preparation of the precursor. This coagulation process is an industrial process with complex mechanism and strict control accuracy requirements. Therefore, iterative optimization based on its strict mechanism model will be much time-consuming. In order to reduce the computational cost, a process optimization method for the coagulation process of carbon liber precursor spinning based on surrogate model was proposed. Using meta-modeling technology, this paper constructs the surrogate model which describes the relationship between the key operating parameters and the main output variables in the coagulation process. In the process of constructing the surrogate model, an evolutionary optimal sample point insertion criterion is adopted to improve the accuracy of the model. And the quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is applied for searching operating parameters in the design space.

During the optimization process, QPSO and IQPSO algorithms minimize the structural weight subject to performance constraints on inter-story drift ratios based on FEMA-356 provisions at the immediate occupancy (IO), life safety (LS) and collapse prevention (CP) performance levels. Nonlinear pushover analysis is conducted to compute the necessary structural responses during the PBOD process. Two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the efficiency of the presented methodology. The numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed IQPSO to the classical QPSO algorithm.","2014-02-01","4/27/2022 13:01","5/5/2022 18:34","4/27/2022 13:01","143-156",null,"2","17",null,"Advances in Structural Engineering",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"SAGE Journals",null,"Publisher: SAGE Publications Ltd STM",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\XTL5YC8J\\Gholizadeh and Moghadas - 2014 - Performance-Based Optimum Design of Steel Frames b.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball",null,null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.625,0.8,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q2",0.544,null,"Manufacturing","Manufacture of basic metals","Casting of metals","Casting of iron and steel"],["XCRU4NTE","journalArticle",2014,"Chen, Wen-Jong; Su, Wen-Cheng; Yang, Yin-Liang","Application of Constrained Multi-Objective Hybrid Quantum Particle Swarm optimization for Improving Performance of an Ironless Permanent Magnet Linear Motor",21100197928.0,null,"Applied Mathematics and Information Sciences",null,null,"10.12785/amis/080652","http://dx.doi.org/10.12785/amis/080652","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","C","27","271","2710","This study presents an ironless permanent magnet linear brushless motor (PMLBM) with three objective functions: maximal thrust force, minimal temperature, and minimal volume.

To validate the feasibility of the proposed approach, several numerical approximation experiments were firstly designed, after which real vibrational data of bearings from the Laboratory of Cincinnati University were analyzed and used to assess the health condition for a given future point.

Here, CEED is represented using cubic criterion function to reduce the nonlinearities of the system. Along with economic load dispatch, emissions of SO2, NOx, and CO2 are considered as separate three objectives, thus making it a four-objective (many-objective) optimization problem. A unit-wise price penalty factor is considered here to convert all the objectives into a single objective in order to compare the final results with other previously used methods like Lagrangian relaxation (LR), particle swarm optimization, and simulated annealing. QBA is applied in six-unit power generation system for four different loads. The obtained results show QBA successfully solve many-objective CEED problem with greater superiority than other methods found in the literature in terms of quality results, robustness, and computational performance. In the end of this paper, a detailed future research direction is provided based on the simulation results and its analysis. The outcome of this research demonstrates that the inclusion of quantum computing idea in metaheuristic technique provides a useful and reliable tool for solving such many-objective optimization problem.","2019-10","4/11/2022 15:14","5/11/2022 16:34",null,"5857-69",null,"10","31",null,"Neural Computing and Applications",null,"Neural Comput.

The bat algorithm (BA) is an acknowledged metaheuristic optimization algorithm owing to its performance. However, the classical BA presents some weaknesses, such as premature convergence. To withstand the drawbacks of the BA, quantum mechanics theories and Gaussian and Cauchy operators are integrated into the standard BA to enhance its effectiveness. Since the economic load dispatch is a nonlinear, complex and constrained optimization problem, its main objective is to reduce the total generation cost while matching the equality and inequality constraints of the system. The validity of the CGQBA is tested on six standard benchmark functions with different characteristics. The numerical results indicate that the CGQBA is effective and superior to many other algorithms. Moreover, the CGQBA is applied to solve the ELD problems on various test systems including 3,6,20, 40,110 and 160 implemented generating units. The simulation results illustrate the strength of the CGQBA compared with other algorithms recently reported in the literature.","2021","5/11/2022 14:23","5/13/2022 22:09",null,"3207-3228",null,null,"9",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.777777778,0.733333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",0.927,null,"Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution"],["VHV33V7W","journalArticle",2019,"Zhang, Z.;

A novel hybrid multi-step-ahead forecast model is introduced to solve this problem. Partial autocorrelation function (PACF) is first used to analyze the characteristics of the target time series for extracting the appropriate input variables. Least-square support vector machine (LSSVM) with recursive mechanism is then explored for modelling multi-step-ahead forecasts, in which the forecast model is adjusted adaptively as long as new information is updated. The parameters in LSSVM are optimized based on an improved quantum-inspired version of Grey Wolf Optimizer (QGWO). The QGWO fortifies against the stagnation of the wolves at an optimal local point using three strategies including the quantum operator, non-linear convergence factor, and dynamic weighting. In this paper, the performance of QGWO was first demonstrated with that of other meta-heuristic (MH) algorithms in solving eight mathematical benchmark problems. Two time series of reservoir water availability in Zhoushan Islands, China, were then provided and analyzed to validate the performance of the advanced forecast approach in multi-step-ahead forecasts. The forecasts were compared with those obtained by the non-adaptive (NA) and non-recursive (NR) models. Results indicate that (1) QGWO displays superior performance on model parameters optimization than other comparative MH algorithms; (2) The proposed hybrid model in consideration of the nearest anterior feedback, as well as the adaptive mechanism, not only outperforms the two comparative models (NA, NR) but significantly enhances the accuracy of multi-step-ahead forecasts for non-stationary time series and low or high volume events, even as the forecast time horizon increases.","2021","5/3/2022 16:13","5/15/2022 16:40",null,"125769",null,null,"597",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\IUR5G3PH\\Guo et al. - 2021 - Multi-step-ahead forecast of reservoir water avail.pdf",null,"included","Adaptive and recursive mechanism; Island areas; Multi-step-ahead forecast; Quantum Grey Wolf Optimizer (QGWO); Reservoir water availability",null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.75,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",1.611,null,"Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities","Water collection, treatment and supply","Water collection, treatment and supply","Water collection, treatment and supply"],["B8A3QEUS","journalArticle",2020,"Feng, Z.-K.; Niu, W.-J.; Tang, Z.-Y.; Jiang, Z.-Q.; Xu, Y.; Liu, Y.; Zhang, H.-R.","Monthly runoff time series prediction by variational mode decomposition and support vector machine based on quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization",50089.0,null,"Journal of Hydrology",null,null,"10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124627","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078757694&doi=10.1016%2fj.jhydrol.2020.124627&partnerID=40&md5=c338003c62335fe67f04f7eb489751b1","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","E","36","360","3600",null,"2020","5/4/2022 11:38","5/16/2022 14:36",null,null,null,null,"583",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Scopus",null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\VYQP9NBE\\Feng et al. - 2020 - Monthly runoff time series prediction by variation.pdf",null,"included","Decomposition and ensemble; Machine learning technique; Monthly runoff prediction; Swarm intelligence method; Three Gorges and Danjiangkou Reservoirs",null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.75,0.733333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",1.684,null,"Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities","Water collection, treatment and supply","Water collection, treatment and supply","Water collection, treatment and supply"],["MXVUMVPM","conferencePaper",2021,"Henderson, Jessie M.; O\u2019Malley, Daniel; Viswanathan, Hari S.","Interrogating the performance of quantum annealing for the solution of steady-state subsurface flow",null,null,"2021 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)",null,null,"10.1109/HPEC49654.2021.9622819",null,"Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Conference","E","36","360","3600","In the 1990s, the principles of quantum mechanics were leveraged to describe how discrete combinatorial optimization problems could be solved using a method called quantum annealing.

In particular, we interrogate whether contemporary quantum annealers with more qubits, lower noise, and reverse annealing features can improve performance.

In this work we investigate the solvability of this problem with a D-Wave quantum annealer. These machines are optimizers for quadratic unconstrained optimization problems (QUBO). Therefore the flight gate assignment problem seems to be well suited for these machines. We use real world data from a mid-sized German airport as well as simulation based data to extract typical instances small enough to be amenable to the D-Wave machine. In order to mitigate precision problems, we employ bin packing on the passenger numbers to reduce the precision requirements of the extracted instances.

How to control the traffic flow to mitigate the congestion has been one of the central issues in transportation research. In this study, we employ a quantum annealing approach to optimize the traffic signals control at a real-life intersection with mixed traffic flows of vehicles and scooters. Considering traffic flow is a continuous and emerging phenomenon, we used quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formalism for traffic optimization, which has a natural equivalence to the Ising model and can be solved efficiently on the quantum annealers, quantum computers or digital annealers. In this article, we first applied the QUBO traffic optimization to artificially generated traffic for a simple intersection, and then we used real-time traffic data to simulate a real \"Dongda-Keyuan\" intersection with dedicated cars and scooter lanes, as well as mixed scooter and car lanes. We introduced two types of traffic light control systems for traffic optimization: C-QUBO and QUBO. Our rigorous QUBO optimizations show that C-QUBO and QUBO outperform the commonly used fixed cycle method, with QUBO outperforming C-QUBO in some instances. It has been found that QUBO optimization significantly relieves traffic congestion for the unbalanced traffic volume.

Rational gate allocation is regarded as one of the most important means to solve this bottleneck. In this paper, in order to comprehensively considere different stakeholders, a three-objective gate allocation model is to consider a wider scope, in which the minimizing passenger walking distances, the most balanced idle time of each gate and the best full use of large gate are optimized simultaneously to improve the practical efficiency. To efficiently solve this model, an improved quantum evolutionary algorithm (QEA) based on the niche co-evolution strategy and enhanced particle swarm optimization (PSO), namely IPOQEA is designed. An IPOQEA-based gate allocation method is proposed to allocate the flights to suitable gates within different periods. Finally, the actual operation data of Baiyun Airport is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Comparison results show that the constructed model can address the passenger walking distances, robustness and costs in airport management. Moreover, the IPOQEA has better optimization ability in solving gate allocation problem. Therefore, the proposed gate allocation method has great potential for practical engineering since it can easily make decisions for airport managers.","2022-03","5/4/2022 10:25","5/13/2022 21:03",null,"1737-1745",null,"3","23",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\SD597D35\\9210735.html;

The indirect optimization method, based on Pontryagin\u2019s maximum principle (PMP), is applied to optimize fuel consumption. To overcome the difficulty in nonsmooth integration caused by the bang-bang control, the homotopy method is adopted to solve the fuel-optimal problem from a related energy-optimal problem. The quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is used to obtain the energy-optimal solutions. The energy-optimal solutions are used as the initial values for the homotopic procedure to obtain the fuel-optimal solutions and optimal bang-bang control law. A hybrid algorithm combined homotopy method and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm is proposed.

Given an initially clustered formation, a configuration, based on satellite coverage requirements, is set as the final configuration which the cluster aims to achieve, with minimal fuel consumption.

In this paper we propose to leverage their capabilities to address an important task for recommender systems providers, the optimal selection of recommendation carousels. In many video-on-demand and music streaming services the user is provided with a homepage containing several recommendation lists, i.e., carousels, each built with a certain criteria (e.g., artist, mood, Action movies etc.). Choosing which set of carousels to display is a difficult problem because it needs to account for how the different recommendation lists interact, e.g., avoiding duplicate recommendations, and how they help the user explore the catalogue. We focus in particular on the adiabatic computing paradigm and use the D-Wave quantum annealer, which is able to solve NP-hard optimization problems, can be programmed by classical operations research tools and is freely available on the cloud. We propose a formulation of the carousel selection problem for black box recommenders, that can be solved effectively on a quantum annealer and has the advantage of being simple.

It is a challenging task to select the requirements from a large number of candidates, for the accomplishment of the business goals. The problem is to identify a set of requirements to be included in the next release of the product, by minimizing the cost and maximizing the customer satisfaction. Since minimizing the total cost and maximizing the customer satisfaction are contradictory objectives, the problem has a multi-objective nature. This problem is NP-hard in its nature and so it cannot be solved efficiently by using traditional optimization techniques for large problem instances. QEMEA combines the best features of Evolutionary Algorithms and Quantum Computing. It employs the concepts of Quantum computing such as superposition and interference. The features of QEMEA help in achieving quality pareto-optimal front solutions and faster convergence while using a small population size. The performance of QEMEA is tested on six benchmark problems derived from the literature. The obtained results indicates consistent and superior performance of the algorithm.","2012-03","4/24/2022 22:18","5/4/2022 12:40",null,"782-787",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\KLUCFBGY\\6215945.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\VDFELL8Q\\Charan Kumari et al. - 2012 - Software requirements selection using Quantum-insp.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball","Benchmark testing; Multi-objective Next Release Problem; Quantum-inspired Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm; Search based software engineering; Software requirements selection",null,"IEEE-International Conference On Advances In Engineering, Science And Management (ICAESM -2012)","NO",null,"NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.375,0.714285714,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"Not assigned","Information and communication","Computer programming, consultancy and related activities","Computer programming, consultancy and related activities","Computer programming activities"],["I6836NX2","journalArticle",2011,"Sun, Jun; Fang, Wei; Wu, Xiaojun; Xie, Zhenping; Xu, Wenbo","QoS multicast routing using a quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm",24182.0,null,"Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence",null,"0952-1976","10.1016/j.engappai.2010.08.001","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197610001454","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","J","63","631","6311","QoS multicast routing in networks is a very important research issue in networks and distributed systems.

In this paper, we propose an improved quantum chaotic animal migration optimization algorithm to solve the multicast routing problem (Multi-Constrained Least Cost MCLC). We used a quantum representation of the solutions that allow the use of the original AMO version without discretization, as well as improving AMO by introducing chaotic map to determine the random numbers. These two contributions improve the diversification and intensification of the algorithm. The simulation results show that our proposed algorithm has a good scalability and efficiency compared with other existing algorithms in the literature.","2018","5/4/2022 12:34","5/16/2022 19:11",null,"128-139",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-89743-1_12",null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.777777778,0.733333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"Not assigned","Information and communication","Information service activities","Data processing, hosting and related activities;

A hybrid QIEA is presented for multiple knapsack problem which incorporates several features for better balance between exploration and exploitation. The proposed QIEA, dubbed QIEA-MKP, provides significantly improved performance over simple QIEA from both the perspectives viz., the quality of solutions and computational effort required to reach the best solution.

Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA), which originates from the organic integration of quantum computing and genetic algorithms, has the advantages of outstanding ability to seek optimal solutions, faster computing speed and smaller overall computing scale, and can solve multi-objective scheduling or optimization problems well. In this paper, the QGA's principle, method and basic flow is introduced, the constraints of the complex curriculum arrangement problem is discussed, and a method to solve the problem of course scheduling in colleges and universities by using this advanced algorithm is also given.

Now, one major drawback of the available models is that they consider the amount of carbon emission associated with various inventory processes like setup process, production process, inventory holding process, etc. as fixed numbers. However, these quantities may not be fixed in reality due to several factors, like the condition of the carbon filtrating apparatus in the production firm, machine breakdown, quality of the raw material, nature of the fuel or energy used, etc. The parameters may vary in between some certain ranges. This paper aims at developing an imperfect production inventory model under the various carbon emission regulatory policies where the various carbon emission parameters are interval numbers. The various inventory cost parameters are also represented as interval numbers to reflect the practical situation. The demand of the product is assumed to be a linearly decreasing function of the selling price of the product. Also, the idea of a new inventory cost component, referred to as the \u2018development cost\u2019 is introduced. Four different policies- simple tax policy, cap and purchase policy, cap and reward policy and strictly under permitted cap policy are discussed, and based on those policies four different inventory models are developed. The Quantum behaved Particle Swarm Optimization(QPSO) algorithm has been applied to find the optimal profit of the manufacturer. The optimal profit obtained here is also an interval number which is quite realistic. The traditional fuzzy or probabilistic approach to represent impreciseness fails to find such kind of solution. A numerical example for every case has been given to illustrate the applicability of the models.

The analyses suggest that the good solutions are clustered in the search space and there is a correlation between the \ufb01tness of a local optimum and its distance to the best solution. Inspired by these \ufb01ndings, a new operator for Quantum Evolutionary Algorithms is proposed which, during the search process, collects information about the \ufb01tness landscape and tried to capture the backbone structure of the landscape. The knowledge it has collected is used to guide the search process towards a better region in the search space. The proposed algorithm consists of two phases. The \ufb01rst phase uses a tabu mechanism to collect information about the \ufb01tness landscape. In the second phase, the collected data are processed to guide the algorithm towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm clusters the good solutions it has found in its previous search process. Then when the population is converged and trapped in a local optimum, it is divided into sub-populations and each sub-population is designated to a cluster. The information in the database is then used to reinitialize the q-individuals, so they represent better regions in the search space. This way the population maintains diversity and by capturing the \ufb01tness landscape structure, the algorithm is guided towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm is compared with some state-ofthe-art algorithms from PATAT competition conferences and experimental results are presented.","2021-04","5/4/2022 14:30","5/13/2022 22:40","5/4/2022 14:30","114211",null,null,"168",null,"Expert Systems with Applications","How to exploit fitness landscape properties of timetabling problem",null,null,null,null,null,null,"en",null,null,null,null,"DOI.org (Crossref)",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\AKDUX97Q\\Najaran - 2021 - How to exploit fitness landscape properties of tim.pdf",null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.875,0.6,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",2.07,null,"Professional, scientific and technical activities","Activities of head offices;

The results show that the QPSO algorithm can traverse and search for a task allocation plan with shorter path and less energy consumption for multiple AUV systems under the same constraints, so that the task allocation can reach the global optimal.

The route planning for UAV on the sea is formulated as an optimization problem. A simple method of pretreatment to the terrain environment is proposed. A novel route planner for UAV is designed to generate a safe and flyable path in the presence of different threat environments based on the DEQPSO algorithm. To show the high performance of the proposed method, the DEQPSO algorithm is compared with the real-valued genetic algorithm, DE, standard particle swarm optimization (PSO), hybrid particle swarm with differential evolution operator, and QPSO in terms of the solution quality, robustness, and the convergence property. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of generating higher quality paths efficiently for UAV than any other tested optimization algorithms.","2013-11","4/24/2022 18:00","5/12/2022 16:05",null,"1451-1465",null,"6","43",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\TU2YN2ZA\\6525428.html;

It arises in practical applications where a set of physical locations need to be equipped with services to satisfy demand within a certain area, while minimizing costs. In this paper we formulate the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, apply the hybrid framework of the D-Wave quantum annealer to solve it, and investigate the feasibility of this approach. To improve the often suboptimal initial solutions found on the D-Wave system, we develop a hybrid quantum/classical optimization algorithm that starts from the seed solution and iteratively creates small subproblems that are more efficiently solved on the D-Wave but often still converge to feasible and improved solutions of the original problem. Finally we suggest some opportunities for increasing the accuracy and performance of our algorithm.","2020","5/11/2022 15:39","5/16/2022 14:41",null,"531-545",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-50433-5_41",null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.666666667,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"A","Public administration and defence; compulsory social security","Public administration and defence; compulsory social security","Administration of the State and the economic and social policy of the community","Regulation of and contribution to more efficient operation of businesses"]],"hovertemplate":"<b>S<sub>S</sub>: %{x}</b><br>S<sub>R</sub>: %{customdata[82]}<br>DOI: %{customdata[10]}<br>ISIC Section: %{customdata[96]}","marker":{"outliercolor":"black"},"meanline":{"color":"black","visible":true},"name":"O","points":"all","x":[0.625,0.444444444,0.375,0.75,0.666666667],"type":"violin"}],                        {"template":{"data":{"pie":[{"automargin":true,"type":"pie"}]},"layout":{"xaxis":{"showgrid":true,"title":{"standoff":15}},"yaxis":{"showgrid":true,"title":{"standoff":15}}}},"xaxis":{"range":[0,1],"title":{"text":"$S_S$"}},"yaxis":{"title":{"text":"ISIC Section"}},"showlegend":false},                        {"responsive": true}                    )                };                            </script>        </div></div>

Most often software product developments are iterative and incremental in their nature, due to the changes in the customer requirements from time to time. It is a challenging task to select the requirements from a large number of candidates, for the accomplishment of the business goals. The problem is to identify a set of requirements to be included in the next release of the product, by minimizing the cost and maximizing the customer satisfaction. Since minimizing the total cost and maximizing the customer satisfaction are contradictory objectives, the problem has a multi-objective nature. This problem is NP-hard in its nature and so it cannot be solved efficiently by using traditional optimization techniques for large problem instances. QEMEA combines the best features of Evolutionary Algorithms and Quantum Computing. It employs the concepts of Quantum computing such as superposition and interference. The features of QEMEA help in achieving quality pareto-optimal front solutions and faster convergence while using a small population size. The performance of QEMEA is tested on six benchmark problems derived from the literature. The obtained results indicates consistent and superior performance of the algorithm.","2012-03","4/24/2022 22:18","5/4/2022 12:40",null,"782-787",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\KLUCFBGY\\6215945.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\VDFELL8Q\\Charan Kumari et al. - 2012 - Software requirements selection using Quantum-insp.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball","Benchmark testing; Multi-objective Next Release Problem; Quantum-inspired Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm; Search based software engineering; Software requirements selection",null,"IEEE-International Conference On Advances In Engineering, Science And Management (ICAESM -2012)","NO",null,"NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.375,0.714285714,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"Not assigned","Information and communication","Computer programming, consultancy and related activities","Computer programming, consultancy and related activities","Computer programming activities"],["A43GXD2L","conferencePaper",2012,"Zhen-xin, Ma; Yue-guang, Li","A New Algorithm and its Application",null,null,"2012 International Conference on Computer Distributed Control and Intelligent Environmental Monitoring",null,null,"10.1109/CDCIEM.2012.17",null,"Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Ant Colony Algorithm",null,null,"Conference","E","38","381","3811","City Litter Transportation Problem (CLTP) is NP-complete problem, most of the algorithms for CLTP are intelligence algorithm and linear programming.

Inspired by strong non-linear learning capability of support vector regression (SVR), this paper presents an SVR model hybridized with the differential empirical mode decomposition (DEMD) method and quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm (QPSO) for electric load forecasting. The DEMD method is employed to decompose the electric load to several detail parts associated with high frequencies (intrinsic mode function-IMF) and an approximate part associated with low frequencies. Hybridized with quantum theory to enhance particle searching performance, the so-called QPSO is used to optimize the parameters of SVR. The electric load data of the New South Wales (Sydney, Australia) market and the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO, New York, USA) are used for comparing the forecasting performances of different forecasting models. The results illustrate the validity of the idea that the proposed model can simultaneously provide forecasting with good accuracy and interpretability.","2016-03","4/11/2022 15:14","5/12/2022 16:15",null,"221 (20 pp.)",null,"3","9",null,"Energies",null,"Energies (Switzerland)",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Place: Switzerland Publisher: MDPI AG",null,";

This paper proposes a novel technique for accurate failure prognosis based on back propagation neural network and quantum multi-agent algorithm. Inspired by the extensive research of quantum computing theory and multi-agent systems, the technique employs a quantum multi-agent strategy, with the main characteristics of quantum agent representation and several operations including fitness evaluation, cooperation, crossover and mutation, for parameters optimization of neural network to avoid the deficiencies such as slow convergence and liability of getting stuck to local minima. To validate the feasibility of the proposed approach, several numerical approximation experiments were firstly designed, after which real vibrational data of bearings from the Laboratory of Cincinnati University were analyzed and used to assess the health condition for a given future point. The results were rather encouraging and indicated that the presented forecasting method has the potential to be utilized as an estimation tool for failure prediction in industrial machinery.","2016-06-01","5/5/2022 18:26","5/16/2022 21:07","5/5/2022 18:26","210-228",null,"2","25",null,"J.

In this paper, we present a real-world application that uses quantum technologies. Specifically, we show how to map certain parts of a real-world traffic flow optimization problem to be suitable for quantum annealing. We show that time-critical optimization tasks, such as continuous redistribution of position data for cars in dense road networks, are suitable candidates for quantum computing. Due to the limited size and connectivity of current-generation D-Wave QPUs, we use a hybrid quantum and classical approach to solve the traffic flow problem.","2017","4/24/2022 18:26","5/13/2022 22:04","4/24/2022 18:26",null,null,null,"4",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Frontiers",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\CTK8HSJK\\Neukart et al. - 2017 - Traffic Flow Optimization Using a Quantum Annealer.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball",null,null,null,"YES","NO","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.625,0.733333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Not assigned","Not assigned",null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Other transportation support activities"],["6WU267MY","journalArticle",2017,"Feng, Zhong-kai; Niu, Wen-jing; Cheng, Chun-tian","Multi-objective quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization for economic environmental hydrothermal energy system scheduling",29348.0,null,"Energy",null,"0360-5442","10.1016/j.energy.2017.05.013","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544217307582","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","D","35","351","3510","With increasing attention paid to energy and environment in recent years, the hydrothermal scheduling considering economic and environmental objectives is becoming one of the most important optimization problems in power system. With two competing objectives and a set of operation constraints, the economic environmental hydrothermal scheduling problem is classified as a typical multi-objective nonlinear constrained optimization problem. Thus, in order to efficiently resolve this problem, the multi-objective quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (MOQPSO) is presented in this paper. In MOQPSO, the elite archive set is adopted to conserve Pareto optimal solutions and provide multiple evolutionary directions for individuals, while the neighborhood searching and chaotic mutation strategies are used to enhance the search capability and diversity of population. Furthermore, a novel constraint handling method is designed to adjust the constraint violation of hydro and thermal plants, respectively. In order to verify its effectiveness, the MOQPSO is applied to a classical hydrothermal system with four hydropower plants and three thermal plants. The simulations show that the proposed method has competitive performance compared with several traditional methods.","2017-07-15","4/26/2022 13:59","5/12/2022 16:09","4/26/2022 13:59","165-178",null,null,"131",null,"Energy",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"en",null,null,null,null,"ScienceDirect",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\P465LNLR\\Feng et al. - 2017 - Multi-objective quantum-behaved particle swarm opt.pdf;

Economic dispatch problem refers to the minimization of generation cost, where environmental dispatch problem refers to the minimization of emission of pollutants like CO2, SO2, and NOx from the power generation system. A quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization (QPSO) technique is presented in this paper to solve many-objective environmental economic dispatch (EED) problems. Emissions of CO2, SO2, and NOx are considered 3 different objectives, thus making it a 4-objective problem considering ED. Many-objective EED problems are defined by using a cubic criterion function, and a max/max price penalty factor is considered to convert all the objectives into a single objective to compare the final results with other well-known methods found in the literature like Lagrangian relaxation, particle swarm optimization, simulated annealing, and quantum-behaved bat algorithm. Quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization is implemented on a 6-unit system to solve many-objective EED problems, and at the same time, to show the effectiveness of QPSO in large systems, it is also implemented in a 26-unit power generation system for ED problem. The obtained results demonstrate and verify the effectiveness and robustness of QPSO to solve many-objective EED problems. This also shows that QPSO can effectively be implemented in such power dispatch problems.","2018","4/27/2022 16:24","5/11/2022 15:55","4/27/2022 16:24","e2497",null,"3","28",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"en",null,null,null,null,"Wiley Online Library",null,"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/etep.2497",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\RKHCJZ95\\Mahdi et al. - 2018 - A quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization app.pdf",null,"included;

We used a quantum representation of the solutions that allow the use of the original AMO version without discretization, as well as improving AMO by introducing chaotic map to determine the random numbers.

However the resulting spin configurations are not always in the ground state. It can rather quickly generate many spin configurations following the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution. In the present study, we formulate an Ising model to control a large number of automated guided vehicles in a factory without collision. We deal with an actual factory in Japan, in which vehicles run, and assess efficiency of our formulation.

In this work we investigate the solvability of this problem with a D-Wave quantum annealer. These machines are optimizers for quadratic unconstrained optimization problems (QUBO). Therefore the flight gate assignment problem seems to be well suited for these machines. We use real world data from a mid-sized German airport as well as simulation based data to extract typical instances small enough to be amenable to the D-Wave machine. In order to mitigate precision problems, we employ bin packing on the passenger numbers to reduce the precision requirements of the extracted instances. We find that, for the instances we investigated, the bin packing has little effect on the solution quality. Hence, we were able to solve small problem instances extracted from real data with the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer.","2019","4/25/2022 14:01","5/13/2022 22:04",null,"99-110",null,null,null,null,null,null,"Lecture Notes in Computer Science",null,null,null,"Springer International Publishing","Cham","en",null,null,null,null,"Springer Link",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\2MYGAWJY\\Stollenwerk et al. - 2019 - Flight Gate Assignment with a Quantum Annealer.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball","Quantum annealing; Airport planning; Quadratic assignment problem; QUBO","Feld, Sebastian; Linnhoff-Popien, Claudia",null,"NO",null,"YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES",null,"NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.571428571,0.642857143,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Service activities incidental to air transportation"],["BBWF6N2E","conferencePaper",2019,"Liu, Bo; Wang, Xiaoping","UAV Route Planning Based on QPSO Algorithm under Rolling Time Domain Control",null,null,"2019 2nd World Conference on Mechanical Engineering and Intelligent Manufacturing (WCMEIM)",null,null,"10.1109/WCMEIM48965.2019.00130",null,"Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Conference","H","52","522","5229","Aiming at the path planning problem of UAVs in complex environments, a RHC-QPSO path planning algorithm is proposed based on the quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm.

The numerical experiments of 17 classical test functions indicate that the presented method can achieve satisfactory results in both convergence speed and global search ability.

NSP seeks the optimal assignment for a set of nurses to shifts under an accompanying set of constraints on schedule and personnel. After reducing NSP to a novel Ising-type Hamiltonian, we evaluate the solution quality obtained from the D-Wave 2000Q against the constraint requirements as well as the diversity of solutions.

Therefore, it is of great significance to extract the useful fault features and diagnose faults based on raw vibration signals. In this paper, a novel deep feature learning method based on the fused-stacked autoencoders (AEs) for planetary gear fault diagnosis was proposed. First, to improve the data learning ability and the robustness of feature extraction process of AE model, the sparse autoencoder (SAE) and the contractive autoencoder (CAE) were studied, respectively. Then, the quantum ant colony algorithm (QACA) was used to optimize the specific location and key parameters of SAEs and CAEs in deep learning architecture, and multiple SAEs and multiple CAEs were stacked alternately to form a novel deep learning architecture, which gave the deep learning architecture better data learning ability and robustness of feature extraction. The experimental results show that the proposed method can address the raw vibration signals of planetary gear. Compared with other deep learning architectures and shallow learning architecture, the proposed method has better diagnosis performance, and it is an effective method of deep feature learning and fault diagnosis.","2019-01","5/11/2022 15:42","5/16/2022 18:44","5/11/2022 15:42","4522",null,"23","12",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",null,null,null,"www.mdpi.com",null,"Number: 23 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\NBX76F2T\\Chen et al. - 2019 - A Novel Deep Feature Learning Method Based on the .pdf;

In reality, demand of a certain product becomes highly effected by on-hand stock level in stores and the selling price of the product. In the proposed model, demand of the product is dependent on these two vital deceive factors. In real life production systems, always there are some defective products which requires reworking in order to make them useful. The possibility of producing some defective items in regular production process and their reworking has been taken into account in the model. In case of inventories of highly demandable products, it is observed that production rate is proportional to demand. The situation also arises in case of launching a new product or in a multi-stage production system. In this model, production rate is a variable and it varies with the demand rate. Shortages are allowed and it is backlogged fully. Based on these assumptions, several researchers worked on but they considered that the associated inventory cost parameters are fixed real numbers. However, these are not fixed in reality and may vary time to time depending upon some scenario. Main objective of the paper is to develop a production inventory model under those assumptions considering various cost parameters as interval numbers. As a result the corresponding optimization problem is also interval valued. Quantum behaved particle swarm optimization technique has been applied to find the maximum profit in a single cycle. Numerical example and sensitivity analysis are given to illustrate the proposed inventory model.  2019, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.","2020","4/11/2022 15:14","5/4/2022 11:23",null,"385-399",null,"2","11",null,"International Journal of Systems Assurance Engineering and Management",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Publisher: Springer",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\TY5WT3EX\\Ruidas et al. - 2020 - An EPQ model with stock and selling price dependen.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13198-019-00867-w","Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Numerical methods; Sensitivity analysis; Inventory control; Defects; included; reverse snowball; forward snowball",null,null,null,"NO",null,"NO","YES",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.25,0.857142857,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q3",0.3,null,"Manufacturing","Manufacture of leather and related products","Tanning and dressing of leather; manufacture of luggage, handbags, saddlery and harness; dressing and dyeing of fur","Manufacture of luggage, handbags and the like, saddlery and harness"],["EEM6Q2MC","journalArticle",2020,"Wang, Yongli; Song, Fuhao; Ma, Yuze; Zhang, Yuli; Yang, Jiale; Liu, Yang; Zhang, Fuwei; Zhu, Jinrong","Research on capacity planning and optimization of regional integrated energy system based on hybrid energy storage system",13688.0,null,"Applied Thermal Engineering",null,"1359-4311","10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2020.115834","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359431120333160","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Genetic Algorithm",null,null,"Journal","D","35","351","3510","Some regional integrated energy systems (RIES) have installed equipments such as wind turbine and photovoltaic, but the fluctuation of these intermittent power supply is large, resulting in a certain amount of energy waste.

In this model, the wavelet packet decomposition method is used to reasonably decompose the high-frequency fluctuation and low-frequency fluctuation of renewable energy to achieve the function of stabilizing fluctuation. Meanwhile, an operation strategy for hybrid energy storage to participate in demand response is proposed. Rain flow counting method is used to research the life of hybrid energy storage system, which improves the accuracy of energy storage annual cost calculation. In the Simulation and Analysis section, the genetic quantum algorithm is used for simulation and analysis of the role and benefits of hybrid energy storage.

The mapping is performed through an original representation of the conflict-resolution problem in terms of a conflict graph, where the nodes of the graph represent flights and the edges represent a potential conflict between flights. The representation allows a natural decomposition of a real-world instance related to wind-optimal trajectories over the Atlantic Ocean into smaller subproblems that can be discretized and are amenable to be programmed in quantum annealers. In this paper, we tested the new programming techniques, and we benchmark the hardness of the instances using both classical solvers and the D-Wave 2X and D-Wave 2000Q quantum chip. The preliminary results show that for reasonable modeling choices, the most challenging subproblems which are programmable in the current devices are solved to optimality with 99% of probability within a second of annealing time.","2020-01","4/25/2022 14:01","5/13/2022 22:04",null,"285-297",null,"1","21",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\PHKJEJMB\\8643733.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\XIFDSBNL\\Stollenwerk et al. - 2020 - Quantum Annealing Applied to De-Conflicting Optima.pdf; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\H9EC435K\\Stollenwerk et al. - 2020 - Quantum Annealing Applied to De-Conflicting Optima.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball","Optimization; Annealing; Quantum computing; Fuels; Quantum Physics; Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms; Trajectory; Air traffic management; classical optimization; Delays; NASA; optimal trajectories; quantum optimization",null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.75,0.8,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",1.591,null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Service activities incidental to air transportation"],["ITNK88F2","conferencePaper",2020,"Sheng, Jiangfan; Kong, Weijian; Qi, Jie","Process optimization of carbon fiber precursor spinning coagulation process based on surrogate model",null,null,"2020 Chinese Automation Congress (CAC)",null,null,"10.1109/CAC51589.2020.9326779",null,"Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Conference","C","23","239","2399","High-quality carbon fiber precursor is the key to the manufacture of high-performance carbon fiber, and the coagulation process is one of the key steps in the preparation of the precursor. This coagulation process is an industrial process with complex mechanism and strict control accuracy requirements. Therefore, iterative optimization based on its strict mechanism model will be much time-consuming. In order to reduce the computational cost, a process optimization method for the coagulation process of carbon liber precursor spinning based on surrogate model was proposed. Using meta-modeling technology, this paper constructs the surrogate model which describes the relationship between the key operating parameters and the main output variables in the coagulation process. In the process of constructing the surrogate model, an evolutionary optimal sample point insertion criterion is adopted to improve the accuracy of the model. And the quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is applied for searching operating parameters in the design space. The simulation results show that the proposed method not only provides a group of satisfactory operating parameters, but also greatly reduces the calculation cost.","2020-11","4/11/2022 15:14","5/12/2022 15:41",null,"6816-6821",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"ISSN: 2688-0938",null,"; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\KN7RFETR\\9326779.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\5S56PYE9\\9326779.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\UESCYFJ7\\Sheng et al. - 2020 - Process optimization of carbon fiber precursor spi.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CAC51589.2020.9326779","included; reverse snowball; forward snowball","Coagulation; Carbon; Mathematical model; Computational modeling; Particle swarm optimization; Process control; carbon fiber precursor; coagulation process; evolutionary optimal sample point insertion criterion; quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization; Spinning; surrogate model",null,"2020 Chinese Automation Congress (CAC)","YES","NO","YES",null,null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.5,0.466666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"Not assigned","Manufacturing","Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products","Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c.","Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products n.e.c."],["EZS8SFEW","journalArticle",2020,"Xin-gang, Zhao; Ji, Liang; Jin, Meng; Ying, Zhou","An improved quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm for environmental economic dispatch",24201.0,null,"Expert Systems with Applications",null,"0957-4174","10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113370","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417420301950","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","D","35","351","3510","Consumption of traditional fossil energy has promoted rapid economic development and caused effects such as climate warming and environmental degradation. In order to solve the problem of environmental economic dispatch (EED), this paper proposes a DE-CQPSO (Differential Evolution-Crossover Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization) algorithm based on the fast convergence of differential evolution algorithms and the particle diversity of crossover operators of genetic algorithms. In order to obtain better optimization results, a parameter adaptive control method is used to update the crossover probability. And the problem of multi-objective optimization is solved by introducing a penalty factor. The experimental results show that: the evaluation index and convergence speed of the DE-CQPSO algorithm are better than QPSO (Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization) and other algorithms, whether it is single-objective optimization of fuel cost and emissions or multi-objective optimization considering both optimization objectives. A good compromise value is verified, which verifies the effectiveness and robustness of the DE-CQPSO algorithm in solving environmental economic dispatch problems. The study provides a new research direction for solving environmental economic dispatch problems. At the same time, it provides a reference for the reasonable output of the unit to a certain extent.","2020-08-15","4/27/2022 16:02","5/12/2022 15:37","4/27/2022 16:02","113370",null,null,"152",null,"Expert Systems with Applications",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"en",null,null,null,null,"ScienceDirect",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\XVM6QIPE\\Xin-gang et al. - 2020 - An improved quantum particle swarm optimization al.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball","Quantum particle swarm optimization; Crossover operator; Adaptive control; Carbon emission reduction; Differential evolution operator; Environmental economic dispatch",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.666666667,0.6,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",1.368,null,"Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution"],["Q6HA4KL8","journalArticle",2020,"Wang, Ziteng; Hu, Zhiyuan; Tang, Yuanjie","Float-Based Resource Leveling Optimization of Linear Projects",21100374601.0,null,"IEEE Access",null,null,"10.1109/access.2020.3027058","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131293130","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","F","41","410","4100","In recent years, the linear scheduling method (LSM) approach to the linear project scheduling optimization problem has been widely studied by researchers.

Firstly, the concept of a third type of float is proposed, and the advantages of this third type of float to the optimization of linear project resource leveling are analyzed. On this basis, a two-stage optimization process of the linear project resource leveling problem based on the third type of float is proposed. The process takes into account new constraints such as total resource constraint, resource utilization constraint, and construction mileage constraint, and it aims to maximize the space-time flexibility of construction activities and realize the depth optimization of linear project resource leveling. According to the integer nonlinear characteristic of the model, a quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm with a constraint processing mechanism and particle search range restriction is designed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model is verified by case analysis and comparison of the results in previous studies.","2020","5/3/2022 16:13","5/15/2022 18:51",null,"176997-177020",null,null,"8",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\AGUAJ3LJ\\9207731.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\FPWAKFEV\\Wang et al. - 2020 - Float-Based Resource Leveling Optimization of Line.pdf",null,"included","Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; project management; Resource management; Schedules; Optimal scheduling; Acceleration; Linear project; optimal scheduling; quantum particle swarm; resource leveling",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.666666667,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",0.587,null,"Construction","Construction of buildings","Construction of buildings","Construction of buildings"],["8FYDFGES","conferencePaper",2020,"James, Scott; Raheb, Robert; Hudak, Allison","UAV Swarm Path Planning",null,null,"2020 Integrated Communications Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS)",null,null,"10.1109/ICNS50378.2020.9223005",null,"Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization",null,null,"Conference","H","52","522","5223","We present an algorithm for the modeling and management of groups of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV).

In this paper we formulate the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, apply the hybrid framework of the D-Wave quantum annealer to solve it, and investigate the feasibility of this approach. To improve the often suboptimal initial solutions found on the D-Wave system, we develop a hybrid quantum/classical optimization algorithm that starts from the seed solution and iteratively creates small subproblems that are more efficiently solved on the D-Wave but often still converge to feasible and improved solutions of the original problem. Finally we suggest some opportunities for increasing the accuracy and performance of our algorithm.","2020","5/11/2022 15:39","5/16/2022 14:41",null,"531-545",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-50433-5_41",null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.666666667,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"A","Public administration and defence;

In this paper we propose to leverage their capabilities to address an important task for recommender systems providers, the optimal selection of recommendation carousels. In many video-on-demand and music streaming services the user is provided with a homepage containing several recommendation lists, i.e., carousels, each built with a certain criteria (e.g., artist, mood, Action movies etc.). Choosing which set of carousels to display is a difficult problem because it needs to account for how the different recommendation lists interact, e.g., avoiding duplicate recommendations, and how they help the user explore the catalogue. We focus in particular on the adiabatic computing paradigm and use the D-Wave quantum annealer, which is able to solve NP-hard optimization problems, can be programmed by classical operations research tools and is freely available on the cloud. We propose a formulation of the carousel selection problem for black box recommenders, that can be solved effectively on a quantum annealer and has the advantage of being simple.

In Asia, the traffic situation can be further deteriorated by road sharing of scooters. How to control the traffic flow to mitigate the congestion has been one of the central issues in transportation research. In this study, we employ a quantum annealing approach to optimize the traffic signals control at a real-life intersection with mixed traffic flows of vehicles and scooters. Considering traffic flow is a continuous and emerging phenomenon, we used quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formalism for traffic optimization, which has a natural equivalence to the Ising model and can be solved efficiently on the quantum annealers, quantum computers or digital annealers. In this article, we first applied the QUBO traffic optimization to artificially generated traffic for a simple intersection, and then we used real-time traffic data to simulate a real \"Dongda-Keyuan\" intersection with dedicated cars and scooter lanes, as well as mixed scooter and car lanes. We introduced two types of traffic light control systems for traffic optimization: C-QUBO and QUBO. Our rigorous QUBO optimizations show that C-QUBO and QUBO outperform the commonly used fixed cycle method, with QUBO outperforming C-QUBO in some instances. It has been found that QUBO optimization significantly relieves traffic congestion for the unbalanced traffic volume. Furthermore, we found that dynamic changes in traffic light signal duration greatly reduce traffic congestion.","2021-11","5/3/2022 15:49","5/13/2022 22:06",null,"74-81",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"ISSN: 2693-8421",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\S84X95F3\\9704985.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\L2YQSACW\\9704985.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\3ZULA6CL\\Singh et al. - 2021 - Quantum Annealing Approach for the Optimal Real-ti.pdf",null,"included","Annealing; Quantum annealing; Urban areas; Motorcycles; Real-time systems; quantum computing; quantum annealing; Correlation; QUBO; real-time optimization; Roads; traffic optimization; traffic signal control",null,"2021 IEEE/ACIS 22nd International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD)","YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.75,0.8,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"C","Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Other transportation support activities"],["BJ2HEZHS","conferencePaper",2021,"Pushpabala, V.; ChristoberAsirRajan, C.","Energy Efficient Based Optimized Renewable Energy Systems (ORES) Using QPSO Technique for Normalized Cost of Energy (NCE)",null,null,"2021 International Conference on System, Computation, Automation and Networking (ICSCAN)",null,null,"10.1109/ICSCAN53069.2021.9526488",null,"Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Conference","D","35","351","3510","Numbers and charts of the world renewable energy agency and the International Energy Agency have lately shown that renewable energy sources (RES) have exceeded natural gas and have taken second place as a power source.

A novel hybrid multi-step-ahead forecast model is introduced to solve this problem.

Least-square support vector machine (LSSVM) with recursive mechanism is then explored for modelling multi-step-ahead forecasts, in which the forecast model is adjusted adaptively as long as new information is updated. The parameters in LSSVM are optimized based on an improved quantum-inspired version of Grey Wolf Optimizer (QGWO). The QGWO fortifies against the stagnation of the wolves at an optimal local point using three strategies including the quantum operator, non-linear convergence factor, and dynamic weighting. In this paper, the performance of QGWO was first demonstrated with that of other meta-heuristic (MH) algorithms in solving eight mathematical benchmark problems. Two time series of reservoir water availability in Zhoushan Islands, China, were then provided and analyzed to validate the performance of the advanced forecast approach in multi-step-ahead forecasts. The forecasts were compared with those obtained by the non-adaptive (NA) and non-recursive (NR) models. Results indicate that (1) QGWO displays superior performance on model parameters optimization than other comparative MH algorithms; (2) The proposed hybrid model in consideration of the nearest anterior feedback, as well as the adaptive mechanism, not only outperforms the two comparative models (NA, NR) but significantly enhances the accuracy of multi-step-ahead forecasts for non-stationary time series and low or high volume events, even as the forecast time horizon increases.","2021","5/3/2022 16:13","5/15/2022 16:40",null,"125769",null,null,"597",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\IUR5G3PH\\Guo et al. - 2021 - Multi-step-ahead forecast of reservoir water avail.pdf",null,"included","Adaptive and recursive mechanism; Island areas; Multi-step-ahead forecast; Quantum Grey Wolf Optimizer (QGWO); Reservoir water availability",null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.75,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",1.611,null,"Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities","Water collection, treatment and supply","Water collection, treatment and supply","Water collection, treatment and supply"],["DQ54M769","journalArticle",2021,"Bodha, Kapil Deo; Yadav, Vinod Kumar; Mukherjee, Vivekananda","A novel quantum inspired hybrid metaheuristic for dispatch of power system including solar photovoltaic generation",4700152713.0,null,"Energy Sources, Part B: Economics, Planning, and Policy",null,null,"10.1080/15567249.2021.1933265","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138664786","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum-inspired Binary TVIW-GSA-PSO",null,null,"Journal","D","35","351","3510","This manuscript proposes a novel metaheuristic, which is an amalgamation of the quantum concept and the gravitational search particle swarm optimization technique.

However, these quantities may not be fixed in reality due to several factors, like the condition of the carbon filtrating apparatus in the production firm, machine breakdown, quality of the raw material, nature of the fuel or energy used, etc. The parameters may vary in between some certain ranges. This paper aims at developing an imperfect production inventory model under the various carbon emission regulatory policies where the various carbon emission parameters are interval numbers. The various inventory cost parameters are also represented as interval numbers to reflect the practical situation. The demand of the product is assumed to be a linearly decreasing function of the selling price of the product. Also, the idea of a new inventory cost component, referred to as the \u2018development cost\u2019 is introduced. Four different policies- simple tax policy, cap and purchase policy, cap and reward policy and strictly under permitted cap policy are discussed, and based on those policies four different inventory models are developed. The Quantum behaved Particle Swarm Optimization(QPSO) algorithm has been applied to find the optimal profit of the manufacturer. The optimal profit obtained here is also an interval number which is quite realistic. The traditional fuzzy or probabilistic approach to represent impreciseness fails to find such kind of solution. A numerical example for every case has been given to illustrate the applicability of the models. Finally, sensitivity analysis of the optimal feasible solution due to variation in some key parameters has been provided with the key managerial insights.","2021-04-01","5/4/2022 11:21","5/18/2022 11:46","5/4/2022 11:21","107154",null,null,"154",null,"Computers & Industrial Engineering",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"en",null,null,null,null,"ScienceDirect",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\ISRLT4XK\\Ruidas et al. - 2021 - A production inventory model with interval-valued .pdf",null,"included","Sustainable production; Imperfect production system; Interval number; Inventory model; Quantum behaved particle swarm optimization technique",null,null,"NO",null,"YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","NO","YES","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.571428571,0.571428571,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",1.775,null,"Professional, scientific and technical activities","Activities of head offices; management consultancy activities","Activities of head offices","Activities of head offices"],["8W6YGRSC","journalArticle",2021,"Shahrabi, E.; Hakimi, S.M.; Hasankhani, A.; Derakhshan, G.; Abdi, B.","Developing optimal energy management of energy hub in the presence of stochastic renewable energy resources",21100371258.0,null,"Sustainable Energy, Grids and Networks",null,null,"10.1016/j.segan.2020.100428","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099229897&doi=10.1016%2fj.segan.2020.100428&partnerID=40&md5=6ed16a65c9d451ad81753c0a11decab0","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","D","35","351","3510",null,"2021","5/4/2022 11:37","5/13/2022 22:07",null,null,null,null,"26",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Scopus",null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\VTY3GGMH\\Shahrabi et al. - 2021 - Developing optimal energy management of energy hub.pdf",null,"included","Energy hub; Energy storage system; Optimal planning and scheduling; Renewable energy system",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.666666667,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",1.2,null,"Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution"],["MXVUMVPM","conferencePaper",2021,"Henderson, Jessie M.; O\u2019Malley, Daniel; Viswanathan, Hari S.","Interrogating the performance of quantum annealing for the solution of steady-state subsurface flow",null,null,"2021 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)",null,null,"10.1109/HPEC49654.2021.9622819",null,"Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Conference","E","36","360","3600","In the 1990s, the principles of quantum mechanics were leveraged to describe how discrete combinatorial optimization problems could be solved using a method called quantum annealing.

The analyses suggest that the good solutions are clustered in the search space and there is a correlation between the \ufb01tness of a local optimum and its distance to the best solution. Inspired by these \ufb01ndings, a new operator for Quantum Evolutionary Algorithms is proposed which, during the search process, collects information about the \ufb01tness landscape and tried to capture the backbone structure of the landscape. The knowledge it has collected is used to guide the search process towards a better region in the search space. The proposed algorithm consists of two phases. The \ufb01rst phase uses a tabu mechanism to collect information about the \ufb01tness landscape. In the second phase, the collected data are processed to guide the algorithm towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm clusters the good solutions it has found in its previous search process. Then when the population is converged and trapped in a local optimum, it is divided into sub-populations and each sub-population is designated to a cluster. The information in the database is then used to reinitialize the q-individuals, so they represent better regions in the search space. This way the population maintains diversity and by capturing the \ufb01tness landscape structure, the algorithm is guided towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm is compared with some state-ofthe-art algorithms from PATAT competition conferences and experimental results are presented.","2021-04","5/4/2022 14:30","5/13/2022 22:40","5/4/2022 14:30","114211",null,null,"168",null,"Expert Systems with Applications","How to exploit fitness landscape properties of timetabling problem",null,null,null,null,null,null,"en",null,null,null,null,"DOI.org (Crossref)",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\AKDUX97Q\\Najaran - 2021 - How to exploit fitness landscape properties of tim.pdf",null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.875,0.6,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",2.07,null,"Professional, scientific and technical activities","Activities of head offices; management consultancy activities","Activities of head offices","Activities of head offices"],["UUUPZZW7","journalArticle",2021,"Zhu, K.; Wang, K.; Zheng, X.; Li, Y.; Liu, J.","Day-ahead optimal strategy for commercial air-conditioning load under time-of-use and demand pricing plan",21100241220.0,null,"International Transactions on Electrical Energy Systems",null,null,"10.1002/2050-7038.12929","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105432898&doi=10.1002%2f2050-7038.12929&partnerID=40&md5=2d2b791e1320bfb0ec8e015f78c9d3ed","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","M","71","711","7110",null,"2021","5/4/2022 14:46","5/13/2022 21:16",null,null,null,"7","31",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Scopus",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.75,0.8,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q2",0.6,null,"Professional, scientific and technical activities","Architectural and engineering activities; technical testing and analysis","Architectural and engineering activities and related technical consultancy","Architectural and engineering activities and related technical consultancy"],["VUUX3YTR","journalArticle",2021,"Wang, Y.; Li, K.; Han, Y.; Yan, X.","Distributed multi-UAV cooperation for dynamic target tracking optimized by an SAQPSO algorithm",29805.0,null,"ISA Transactions",null,null,"10.1016/j.isatra.2021.12.014","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122086191&doi=10.1016%2fj.isatra.2021.12.014&partnerID=40&md5=53e7d5599abb0a6cdd6f85b5a9347063","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","M","71","711","7110",null,"2021","5/4/2022 14:46","5/13/2022 21:32",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Scopus",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","NO","NO","YES",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.444444444,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",1.474,null,"Professional, scientific and technical activities","Architectural and engineering activities; technical testing and analysis","Architectural and engineering activities and related technical consultancy","Architectural and engineering activities and related technical consultancy"],["2R7SJU7Q","bookSection",2021,"Phillipson, F.; Chiscop, I.","Multimodal Container Planning: A QUBO Formulation and Implementation on a Quantum Annealer",null,952.0,"Computational Science \u2013 ICCS 2021",null,null,"10.1007/978-3-030-77980-1_3","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138731251","Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Conference","H","52","522","5229","Quantum computing is developing fast.

The bat algorithm (BA) is an acknowledged metaheuristic optimization algorithm owing to its performance. However, the classical BA presents some weaknesses, such as premature convergence. To withstand the drawbacks of the BA, quantum mechanics theories and Gaussian and Cauchy operators are integrated into the standard BA to enhance its effectiveness. Since the economic load dispatch is a nonlinear, complex and constrained optimization problem, its main objective is to reduce the total generation cost while matching the equality and inequality constraints of the system. The validity of the CGQBA is tested on six standard benchmark functions with different characteristics.

In this paper, in order to comprehensively considere different stakeholders, a three-objective gate allocation model is to consider a wider scope, in which the minimizing passenger walking distances, the most balanced idle time of each gate and the best full use of large gate are optimized simultaneously to improve the practical efficiency. To efficiently solve this model, an improved quantum evolutionary algorithm (QEA) based on the niche co-evolution strategy and enhanced particle swarm optimization (PSO), namely IPOQEA is designed. An IPOQEA-based gate allocation method is proposed to allocate the flights to suitable gates within different periods. Finally, the actual operation data of Baiyun Airport is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Comparison results show that the constructed model can address the passenger walking distances, robustness and costs in airport management. Moreover, the IPOQEA has better optimization ability in solving gate allocation problem. Therefore, the proposed gate allocation method has great potential for practical engineering since it can easily make decisions for airport managers.","2022-03","5/4/2022 10:25","5/13/2022 21:03",null,"1737-1745",null,"3","23",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\SD597D35\\9210735.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\AVL4TNSW\\Deng et al. - 2022 - A Novel Gate Resource Allocation Method Using Impr.pdf",null,"included","Optimization; Logic gates; Airports; Resource management; Statistics; Sociology; Atmospheric modeling; Gate allocation model; improved rotation gates; multi-objective; niche co-evolution strategy; PSO; QEA",null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.75,0.6,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Not assigned","Not assigned",null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Service activities incidental to air transportation"],["5LY5Q8VP","journalArticle",2022,"Lakshmi, K.; Nagineni, S.; Lydia, E.L.; Devaraj, A.F.S.; Mohanty, S.N.; Pustokhina, I.V.; Pustokhin, D.A.","An Optimal Deep Learning for Cooperative Intelligent Transportation System",24364.0,null,"Computers, Materials and Continua",null,null,"10.32604/cmc.2022.020244","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125716670&doi=10.32604%2fcmc.2022.020244&partnerID=40&md5=91cfdb5dac196e05ee392cae2bd97050","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Bat Algorithm",null,null,"Journal","H","52","522","5229",null,"2022","5/11/2022 16:29","5/12/2022 23:24",null,"19-35",null,"1","72",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Scopus",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.555555556,0.533333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Not assigned","Not assigned",null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Other transportation support activities"],["VC8AN3LH","journalArticle",2022,"Si, Yupeng; Wang, Rongjie; Zhang, Shiqi; Zhou, Wenting; Lin, Anhui; Zeng, Guangmiao","Configuration optimization and energy management of hybrid energy system for marine using quantum computing",29348.0,null,"Energy",null,null,"10.1016/j.energy.2022.124131","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147472544","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","C","27","271","2710","Improving the technology of hybrid energy systems is an important development direction for the greening of ships, it is vital to the hybrid energy system configuration optimization and energy management to enhance the marine electric power system reliability, economic efficiency, and sustainability. Focusing on this problem, this paper has carried out a study on the multi-objective configuration optimization method (COM) and energy management strategy (EMS) for ship hybrid energy systems based on quantum computing. First, the mathematical model of distributed power modules of the hybrid energy system is established, and a configuration optimization objective function that aims at low-cost, long equipment life, and high reliability of power supply is constructed. Then, the combination with fuzzy rules and quantum multi-objective artificial bee colony algorithm to solve the objective function, the configuration scheme satisfying multiple constraints is obtained.

Here, CEED is represented using cubic criterion function to reduce the nonlinearities of the system. Along with economic load dispatch, emissions of SO2, NOx, and CO2 are considered as separate three objectives, thus making it a four-objective (many-objective) optimization problem. A unit-wise price penalty factor is considered here to convert all the objectives into a single objective in order to compare the final results with other previously used methods like Lagrangian relaxation (LR), particle swarm optimization, and simulated annealing. QBA is applied in six-unit power generation system for four different loads. The obtained results show QBA successfully solve many-objective CEED problem with greater superiority than other methods found in the literature in terms of quality results, robustness, and computational performance. In the end of this paper, a detailed future research direction is provided based on the simulation results and its analysis. The outcome of this research demonstrates that the inclusion of quantum computing idea in metaheuristic technique provides a useful and reliable tool for solving such many-objective optimization problem.","2019-10","4/11/2022 15:14","5/11/2022 16:34",null,"5857-69",null,"10","31",null,"Neural Computing and Applications",null,"Neural Comput.

The DEMD method is employed to decompose the electric load to several detail parts associated with high frequencies (intrinsic mode function-IMF) and an approximate part associated with low frequencies. Hybridized with quantum theory to enhance particle searching performance, the so-called QPSO is used to optimize the parameters of SVR. The electric load data of the New South Wales (Sydney, Australia) market and the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO, New York, USA) are used for comparing the forecasting performances of different forecasting models.

In reality, demand of a certain product becomes highly effected by on-hand stock level in stores and the selling price of the product. In the proposed model, demand of the product is dependent on these two vital deceive factors. In real life production systems, always there are some defective products which requires reworking in order to make them useful. The possibility of producing some defective items in regular production process and their reworking has been taken into account in the model. In case of inventories of highly demandable products, it is observed that production rate is proportional to demand. The situation also arises in case of launching a new product or in a multi-stage production system. In this model, production rate is a variable and it varies with the demand rate. Shortages are allowed and it is backlogged fully. Based on these assumptions, several researchers worked on but they considered that the associated inventory cost parameters are fixed real numbers. However, these are not fixed in reality and may vary time to time depending upon some scenario. Main objective of the paper is to develop a production inventory model under those assumptions considering various cost parameters as interval numbers. As a result the corresponding optimization problem is also interval valued. Quantum behaved particle swarm optimization technique has been applied to find the maximum profit in a single cycle. Numerical example and sensitivity analysis are given to illustrate the proposed inventory model.  2019, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.","2020","4/11/2022 15:14","5/4/2022 11:23",null,"385-399",null,"2","11",null,"International Journal of Systems Assurance Engineering and Management",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Publisher: Springer",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\TY5WT3EX\\Ruidas et al. - 2020 - An EPQ model with stock and selling price dependen.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13198-019-00867-w","Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Numerical methods; Sensitivity analysis; Inventory control; Defects; included; reverse snowball; forward snowball",null,null,null,"NO",null,"NO","YES",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.25,0.857142857,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q3",0.3,null,"Manufacturing","Manufacture of leather and related products","Tanning and dressing of leather; manufacture of luggage, handbags, saddlery and harness; dressing and dyeing of fur","Manufacture of luggage, handbags and the like, saddlery and harness"],["EEM6Q2MC","journalArticle",2020,"Wang, Yongli; Song, Fuhao; Ma, Yuze; Zhang, Yuli; Yang, Jiale; Liu, Yang; Zhang, Fuwei; Zhu, Jinrong","Research on capacity planning and optimization of regional integrated energy system based on hybrid energy storage system",13688.0,null,"Applied Thermal Engineering",null,"1359-4311","10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2020.115834","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359431120333160","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Genetic Algorithm",null,null,"Journal","D","35","351","3510","Some regional integrated energy systems (RIES) have installed equipments such as wind turbine and photovoltaic, but the fluctuation of these intermittent power supply is large, resulting in a certain amount of energy waste.

In this model, the wavelet packet decomposition method is used to reasonably decompose the high-frequency fluctuation and low-frequency fluctuation of renewable energy to achieve the function of stabilizing fluctuation.

The route planning for UAV on the sea is formulated as an optimization problem. A simple method of pretreatment to the terrain environment is proposed. A novel route planner for UAV is designed to generate a safe and flyable path in the presence of different threat environments based on the DEQPSO algorithm. To show the high performance of the proposed method, the DEQPSO algorithm is compared with the real-valued genetic algorithm, DE, standard particle swarm optimization (PSO), hybrid particle swarm with differential evolution operator, and QPSO in terms of the solution quality, robustness, and the convergence property. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of generating higher quality paths efficiently for UAV than any other tested optimization algorithms.","2013-11","4/24/2022 18:00","5/12/2022 16:05",null,"1451-1465",null,"6","43",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\TU2YN2ZA\\6525428.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\H4UL4QVU\\Fu et al. - 2013 - Route Planning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) o.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball","Particle swarm optimization; Unmanned aerial vehicles; Differential evolution (DE); Path planning; quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO); route planning; terrain pretreatment; unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)",null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.625,0.733333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",1.403,null,"Public administration and defence; compulsory social security","Public administration and defence; compulsory social security","Provision of services to the community as a whole","Defence activities"],["KKR576SB","journalArticle",2017,"Neukart, Florian; Compostella, Gabriele; Seidel, Christian; von Dollen, David; Yarkoni, Sheir; Parney, Bob","Traffic Flow Optimization Using a Quantum Annealer",21100893766.0,null,"Frontiers in ICT",null,"2297-198X","10.3389/fict.2017.00029","https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fict.2017.00029","Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Journal","H","52","522","5229","Quantum annealing algorithms belong to the class of metaheuristic tools, applicable for solving binary optimization problems.

In this paper, the problem of resource leveling of linear projects under the framework of LSM is studied. Firstly, the concept of a third type of float is proposed, and the advantages of this third type of float to the optimization of linear project resource leveling are analyzed. On this basis, a two-stage optimization process of the linear project resource leveling problem based on the third type of float is proposed. The process takes into account new constraints such as total resource constraint, resource utilization constraint, and construction mileage constraint, and it aims to maximize the space-time flexibility of construction activities and realize the depth optimization of linear project resource leveling. According to the integer nonlinear characteristic of the model, a quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm with a constraint processing mechanism and particle search range restriction is designed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model is verified by case analysis and comparison of the results in previous studies.","2020","5/3/2022 16:13","5/15/2022 18:51",null,"176997-177020",null,null,"8",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\AGUAJ3LJ\\9207731.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\FPWAKFEV\\Wang et al. - 2020 - Float-Based Resource Leveling Optimization of Line.pdf",null,"included","Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; project management; Resource management; Schedules; Optimal scheduling; Acceleration; Linear project; optimal scheduling; quantum particle swarm; resource leveling",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.666666667,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",0.587,null,"Construction","Construction of buildings","Construction of buildings","Construction of buildings"],["HZBHE4J5","journalArticle",2021,"Guo, Yuxue; Xu, Yue-Ping; Sun, Mengcheng; Xie, Jingkai","Multi-step-ahead forecast of reservoir water availability with improved quantum-based GWO coupled with the AI-based LSSVM model",50089.0,null,"Journal of Hydrology",null,null,"10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125769","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132664940","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum-based Grey Wolf Optimizer",null,null,"Journal","E","36","360","3600","It remains a challenge to obtain an accurate multi-step-ahead forecast of reservoir water availability for island areas. A novel hybrid multi-step-ahead forecast model is introduced to solve this problem. Partial autocorrelation function (PACF) is first used to analyze the characteristics of the target time series for extracting the appropriate input variables. Least-square support vector machine (LSSVM) with recursive mechanism is then explored for modelling multi-step-ahead forecasts, in which the forecast model is adjusted adaptively as long as new information is updated. The parameters in LSSVM are optimized based on an improved quantum-inspired version of Grey Wolf Optimizer (QGWO). The QGWO fortifies against the stagnation of the wolves at an optimal local point using three strategies including the quantum operator, non-linear convergence factor, and dynamic weighting. In this paper, the performance of QGWO was first demonstrated with that of other meta-heuristic (MH) algorithms in solving eight mathematical benchmark problems. Two time series of reservoir water availability in Zhoushan Islands, China, were then provided and analyzed to validate the performance of the advanced forecast approach in multi-step-ahead forecasts. The forecasts were compared with those obtained by the non-adaptive (NA) and non-recursive (NR) models. Results indicate that (1) QGWO displays superior performance on model parameters optimization than other comparative MH algorithms; (2) The proposed hybrid model in consideration of the nearest anterior feedback, as well as the adaptive mechanism, not only outperforms the two comparative models (NA, NR) but significantly enhances the accuracy of multi-step-ahead forecasts for non-stationary time series and low or high volume events, even as the forecast time horizon increases.","2021","5/3/2022 16:13","5/15/2022 16:40",null,"125769",null,null,"597",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\IUR5G3PH\\Guo et al. - 2021 - Multi-step-ahead forecast of reservoir water avail.pdf",null,"included","Adaptive and recursive mechanism; Island areas; Multi-step-ahead forecast; Quantum Grey Wolf Optimizer (QGWO); Reservoir water availability",null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.75,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",1.611,null,"Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities","Water collection, treatment and supply","Water collection, treatment and supply","Water collection, treatment and supply"],["DQ54M769","journalArticle",2021,"Bodha, Kapil Deo; Yadav, Vinod Kumar; Mukherjee, Vivekananda","A novel quantum inspired hybrid metaheuristic for dispatch of power system including solar photovoltaic generation",4700152713.0,null,"Energy Sources, Part B: Economics, Planning, and Policy",null,null,"10.1080/15567249.2021.1933265","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138664786","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum-inspired Binary TVIW-GSA-PSO",null,null,"Journal","D","35","351","3510","This manuscript proposes a novel metaheuristic, which is an amalgamation of the quantum concept and the gravitational search particle swarm optimization technique.

An adaptive contraction expansion factor is also introduced which ensures better exploration of the algorithm. The technique is applied to solve the combined economic emission dispatch of a hybrid solar thermal unit operating in New Delhi, India for full and reduced solar radiation. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed technique, it is also applied to solve the combined economic emission dispatch of a 10 unit, 2000 MW system.

Rational gate allocation is regarded as one of the most important means to solve this bottleneck. In this paper, in order to comprehensively considere different stakeholders, a three-objective gate allocation model is to consider a wider scope, in which the minimizing passenger walking distances, the most balanced idle time of each gate and the best full use of large gate are optimized simultaneously to improve the practical efficiency. To efficiently solve this model, an improved quantum evolutionary algorithm (QEA) based on the niche co-evolution strategy and enhanced particle swarm optimization (PSO), namely IPOQEA is designed. An IPOQEA-based gate allocation method is proposed to allocate the flights to suitable gates within different periods. Finally, the actual operation data of Baiyun Airport is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Comparison results show that the constructed model can address the passenger walking distances, robustness and costs in airport management. Moreover, the IPOQEA has better optimization ability in solving gate allocation problem. Therefore, the proposed gate allocation method has great potential for practical engineering since it can easily make decisions for airport managers.","2022-03","5/4/2022 10:25","5/13/2022 21:03",null,"1737-1745",null,"3","23",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\SD597D35\\9210735.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\AVL4TNSW\\Deng et al. - 2022 - A Novel Gate Resource Allocation Method Using Impr.pdf",null,"included","Optimization; Logic gates; Airports; Resource management; Statistics; Sociology; Atmospheric modeling; Gate allocation model; improved rotation gates; multi-objective; niche co-evolution strategy; PSO; QEA",null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.75,0.6,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Not assigned","Not assigned",null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Service activities incidental to air transportation"],["B7QM3W94","journalArticle",2019,"Ikeda, Kazuki; Nakamura, Yuma; Humble, Travis S.","Application of Quantum Annealing to Nurse Scheduling Problem",21100200805.0,null,"Scientific Reports",null,null,"10.1038/s41598-019-49172-3","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120878833","Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Journal","Q","86","861","8610","Quantum annealing is a promising heuristic method to solve combinatorial optimization problems, and efforts to quantify performance on real-world problems provide insights into how this approach may be best used in practice.

NSP seeks the optimal assignment for a set of nurses to shifts under an accompanying set of constraints on schedule and personnel. After reducing NSP to a novel Ising-type Hamiltonian, we evaluate the solution quality obtained from the D-Wave 2000Q against the constraint requirements as well as the diversity of solutions. For the test problems explored here, our results indicate that quantum annealing recovers satisfying solutions for NSP and suggests the heuristic method is potentially achievable for practical use. Moreover, we observe that solution quality can be greatly improved through the use of reverse annealing, in which it is possible to refine returned results by using the annealing process a second time.

Now, one major drawback of the available models is that they consider the amount of carbon emission associated with various inventory processes like setup process, production process, inventory holding process, etc. as fixed numbers. However, these quantities may not be fixed in reality due to several factors, like the condition of the carbon filtrating apparatus in the production firm, machine breakdown, quality of the raw material, nature of the fuel or energy used, etc. The parameters may vary in between some certain ranges. This paper aims at developing an imperfect production inventory model under the various carbon emission regulatory policies where the various carbon emission parameters are interval numbers. The various inventory cost parameters are also represented as interval numbers to reflect the practical situation. The demand of the product is assumed to be a linearly decreasing function of the selling price of the product. Also, the idea of a new inventory cost component, referred to as the \u2018development cost\u2019 is introduced. Four different policies- simple tax policy, cap and purchase policy, cap and reward policy and strictly under permitted cap policy are discussed, and based on those policies four different inventory models are developed. The Quantum behaved Particle Swarm Optimization(QPSO) algorithm has been applied to find the optimal profit of the manufacturer. The optimal profit obtained here is also an interval number which is quite realistic. The traditional fuzzy or probabilistic approach to represent impreciseness fails to find such kind of solution. A numerical example for every case has been given to illustrate the applicability of the models. Finally, sensitivity analysis of the optimal feasible solution due to variation in some key parameters has been provided with the key managerial insights.","2021-04-01","5/4/2022 11:21","5/18/2022 11:46","5/4/2022 11:21","107154",null,null,"154",null,"Computers & Industrial Engineering",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"en",null,null,null,null,"ScienceDirect",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\ISRLT4XK\\Ruidas et al. - 2021 - A production inventory model with interval-valued .pdf",null,"included","Sustainable production;

The analyses suggest that the good solutions are clustered in the search space and there is a correlation between the \ufb01tness of a local optimum and its distance to the best solution. Inspired by these \ufb01ndings, a new operator for Quantum Evolutionary Algorithms is proposed which, during the search process, collects information about the \ufb01tness landscape and tried to capture the backbone structure of the landscape. The knowledge it has collected is used to guide the search process towards a better region in the search space. The proposed algorithm consists of two phases. The \ufb01rst phase uses a tabu mechanism to collect information about the \ufb01tness landscape. In the second phase, the collected data are processed to guide the algorithm towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm clusters the good solutions it has found in its previous search process. Then when the population is converged and trapped in a local optimum, it is divided into sub-populations and each sub-population is designated to a cluster. The information in the database is then used to reinitialize the q-individuals, so they represent better regions in the search space. This way the population maintains diversity and by capturing the \ufb01tness landscape structure, the algorithm is guided towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm is compared with some state-ofthe-art algorithms from PATAT competition conferences and experimental results are presented.","2021-04","5/4/2022 14:30","5/13/2022 22:40","5/4/2022 14:30","114211",null,null,"168",null,"Expert Systems with Applications","How to exploit fitness landscape properties of timetabling problem",null,null,null,null,null,null,"en",null,null,null,null,"DOI.org (Crossref)",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\AKDUX97Q\\Najaran - 2021 - How to exploit fitness landscape properties of tim.pdf",null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.875,0.6,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",2.07,null,"Professional, scientific and technical activities","Activities of head offices;

This paper proposes a novel technique for accurate failure prognosis based on back propagation neural network and quantum multi-agent algorithm. Inspired by the extensive research of quantum computing theory and multi-agent systems, the technique employs a quantum multi-agent strategy, with the main characteristics of quantum agent representation and several operations including fitness evaluation, cooperation, crossover and mutation, for parameters optimization of neural network to avoid the deficiencies such as slow convergence and liability of getting stuck to local minima. To validate the feasibility of the proposed approach, several numerical approximation experiments were firstly designed, after which real vibrational data of bearings from the Laboratory of Cincinnati University were analyzed and used to assess the health condition for a given future point. The results were rather encouraging and indicated that the presented forecasting method has the potential to be utilized as an estimation tool for failure prediction in industrial machinery.","2016-06-01","5/5/2022 18:26","5/16/2022 21:07","5/5/2022 18:26","210-228",null,"2","25",null,"J.

Focusing on this problem, this paper has carried out a study on the multi-objective configuration optimization method (COM) and energy management strategy (EMS) for ship hybrid energy systems based on quantum computing. First, the mathematical model of distributed power modules of the hybrid energy system is established, and a configuration optimization objective function that aims at low-cost, long equipment life, and high reliability of power supply is constructed. Then, the combination with fuzzy rules and quantum multi-objective artificial bee colony algorithm to solve the objective function, the configuration scheme satisfying multiple constraints is obtained. On this basis, an energy management optimization objective function that meets both low-cost operation and maximum clean energy utilization for ship electric power system is established, an objective function is optimized in multi-objective quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm, the real-time optimal scheduling for hybrid energy systems of the ship is realized.

Furthermore, energy management experiments using different strategies, experimental results show that the energy management strategy proposed in this paper outperforms other methods, effectively reduces the operating costs, fuel costs, and pollutant emissions of marine power system, meet the environmental requirements of the Energy Efficiency Operating Index (EEOI) for ships.","2022","5/11/2022 15:23","5/12/2022 23:07",null,"124131",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\Y4Z27BYU\\Si et al. - 2022 - Configuration optimization and energy management o.pdf",null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.75,0.733333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Not assigned","Not assigned",null,"Manufacturing","Manufacture of electrical equipment","Manufacture of electric motors, generators, transformers and electricity distribution and control apparatus","Manufacture of electric motors, generators, transformers and electricity distribution and control apparatus"],["L3XSL988","journalArticle",2022,"Silva, A.; Zabaleta, O.G.; Arizmendi, C.M.","Mitigation of Routing Congestion on Data Networks: A Quantum Game Theory Approach",21101043793.0,null,"Quantum Reports",null,null,"10.3390/quantum4020010","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127932184&doi=10.3390%2fquantum4020010&partnerID=40&md5=27a0e76b8399f617b7c3d982caceeec0","Hybrid","Quantum","Quantum Circuit","Real Quantum Computer","Gate-based","Journal","H","50","501","5012",null,"2022","5/11/2022 15:25","5/12/2022 23:07",null,"135-147",null,"2","4",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Scopus",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES","NO",null,"YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.555555556,0.533333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Not assigned","Not assigned",null,"Transportation and storage","Water transport","Sea and coastal water transport","Sea and coastal freight water transport"],["AG8T9SYN","journalArticle",2021,"Ren, F.; Feng, W.","Homotopy-SQP coupled method for optimal control of far-distance nonplanar rapid cooperative rendezvous with multiple specific-direction thrusts",12375.0,null,"Advances in Space Research",null,null,"10.1016/j.asr.2021.06.019","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108534059&doi=10.1016%2fj.asr.2021.06.019&partnerID=40&md5=d0f1f164de3e477f78bbf3106d628f2c","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","H","52","522","5229",null,"2021","5/11/2022 16:08","5/13/2022 22:17",null,"3176-3190",null,"8","68",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Scopus",null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\AMEIJWDS\\Ren and Feng - 2021 - Homotopy-SQP coupled method for optimal control of.pdf; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\F9QSFPRB\\S0273117721004890.html",null,"included","Optimal control; Cooperative rendezvous; Multiple specific-direction thrusts; Indirect method; Intelligent algorithm",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","NO","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.555555556,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q2",0.613,null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Other transportation support activities"],["KPLNY54V","journalArticle",2021,"Ren, Fei","Optimization for Far-distance Cooperative Rendezvous with Multiple Direction-fixed Thrusts",130053.0,null,"Journal of Physics: Conference Series",null,null,"10.1088/1742-6596/2068/1/012021","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142466149","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","H","52","522","5229","The continuous-thrust far-distance cooperative rendezvous problem between two spacecraft is investigated. The indirect optimization method, based on Pontryagin\u2019s maximum principle (PMP), is applied to optimize fuel consumption. To overcome the difficulty in nonsmooth integration caused by the bang-bang control, the homotopy method is adopted to solve the fuel-optimal problem from a related energy-optimal problem. The quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is used to obtain the energy-optimal solutions. The energy-optimal solutions are used as the initial values for the homotopic procedure to obtain the fuel-optimal solutions and optimal bang-bang control law. A hybrid algorithm combined homotopy method and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm is proposed. This hybrid algorithm can effectively obtain feasible optimal solutions even though the indirect optimization method exhibits a narrow convergence domain.

The bat algorithm (BA) is an acknowledged metaheuristic optimization algorithm owing to its performance. However, the classical BA presents some weaknesses, such as premature convergence. To withstand the drawbacks of the BA, quantum mechanics theories and Gaussian and Cauchy operators are integrated into the standard BA to enhance its effectiveness. Since the economic load dispatch is a nonlinear, complex and constrained optimization problem, its main objective is to reduce the total generation cost while matching the equality and inequality constraints of the system. The validity of the CGQBA is tested on six standard benchmark functions with different characteristics. The numerical results indicate that the CGQBA is effective and superior to many other algorithms. Moreover, the CGQBA is applied to solve the ELD problems on various test systems including 3,6,20, 40,110 and 160 implemented generating units. The simulation results illustrate the strength of the CGQBA compared with other algorithms recently reported in the literature.","2021","5/11/2022 14:23","5/13/2022 22:09",null,"3207-3228",null,null,"9",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.777777778,0.733333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",0.927,null,"Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution"],["7JNJSF6F","journalArticle",2021,"Ding, Yongcheng; Chen, Xi; Lamata, Lucas; Solano, Enrique; Sanz, Mikel","Implementation of a Hybrid Classical-Quantum Annealing Algorithm for Logistic Network Design",null,null,"SN Computer Science",null,null,"10.1007/s42979-021-00466-2","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1135072547","Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Journal","H","52","522","5229","The logistic network design is an abstract optimization problem that, under the assumption of minimal cost, seeks the optimal configuration of the supply chain\u2019s infrastructures and facilities based on customer demand.

It was only recently that small but functional quantum computers have become available on the cloud, allowing to test their potential. In this paper we propose to leverage their capabilities to address an important task for recommender systems providers, the optimal selection of recommendation carousels. In many video-on-demand and music streaming services the user is provided with a homepage containing several recommendation lists, i.e., carousels, each built with a certain criteria (e.g., artist, mood, Action movies etc.). Choosing which set of carousels to display is a difficult problem because it needs to account for how the different recommendation lists interact, e.g., avoiding duplicate recommendations, and how they help the user explore the catalogue. We focus in particular on the adiabatic computing paradigm and use the D-Wave quantum annealer, which is able to solve NP-hard optimization problems, can be programmed by classical operations research tools and is freely available on the cloud. We propose a formulation of the carousel selection problem for black box recommenders, that can be solved effectively on a quantum annealer and has the advantage of being simple. We discuss its effectiveness, limitations and possible future directions of development.  2021 Owner/Author.","2021","4/11/2022 15:14","5/13/2022 22:04",null,"691-696",null,null,null,null,null,null,"RecSys 2021 - 15th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems",null,null,null,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","Virtual, Online, Netherlands",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\B9BIPMP8\\Ferrari Dacrema et al. - 2021 - Optimizing the selection of recommendation carouse.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3460231.3478853","Optimization; Annealing; Quantum computers; Recommender systems; Operations research; User interfaces; Video on demand; included; reverse snowball; forward snowball",null,null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","NO",null,"NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",0.714285714,0.866666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"A","Information and communication","Information service activities","Data processing, hosting and related activities; web portals","Data processing, hosting and related activities"],["G5PG4F3Y","conferencePaper",2020,"Fernandes, Clifford; Lobo, Desmond; Gawane, Sarang; Wagaskar, Kalpita","Proposed quantum AI solution for the travelling tournament problem",null,null,"2020 International Conference for Emerging Technology, INCET 2020, June 5, 2020  -  June 7, 2020",null,null,"10.1109/INCET49848.2020.9154037",null,"Hybrid","Quantum","Quantum Circuit",null,"Gate-based","Conference","R","93","931","9312","In this paper, we propose an idea/solution for the Travelling Tournament Problem, which is a unique combinatorial problem tackling both feasibility and optimality of the solution.

Quantum Computing and artificial intelligence, on the other hand, is making great strides, and we believe that the immense computational potential of quantum computing can be used to solve these scheduling problems.

Most often software product developments are iterative and incremental in their nature, due to the changes in the customer requirements from time to time. It is a challenging task to select the requirements from a large number of candidates, for the accomplishment of the business goals. The problem is to identify a set of requirements to be included in the next release of the product, by minimizing the cost and maximizing the customer satisfaction. Since minimizing the total cost and maximizing the customer satisfaction are contradictory objectives, the problem has a multi-objective nature. This problem is NP-hard in its nature and so it cannot be solved efficiently by using traditional optimization techniques for large problem instances. QEMEA combines the best features of Evolutionary Algorithms and Quantum Computing. It employs the concepts of Quantum computing such as superposition and interference. The features of QEMEA help in achieving quality pareto-optimal front solutions and faster convergence while using a small population size. The performance of QEMEA is tested on six benchmark problems derived from the literature. The obtained results indicates consistent and superior performance of the algorithm.","2012-03","4/24/2022 22:18","5/4/2022 12:40",null,"782-787",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\KLUCFBGY\\6215945.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\VDFELL8Q\\Charan Kumari et al. - 2012 - Software requirements selection using Quantum-insp.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball","Benchmark testing; Multi-objective Next Release Problem; Quantum-inspired Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm; Search based software engineering; Software requirements selection",null,"IEEE-International Conference On Advances In Engineering, Science And Management (ICAESM -2012)","NO",null,"NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.375,0.714285714,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"Not assigned","Information and communication","Computer programming, consultancy and related activities","Computer programming, consultancy and related activities","Computer programming activities"],["ITNK88F2","conferencePaper",2020,"Sheng, Jiangfan; Kong, Weijian; Qi, Jie","Process optimization of carbon fiber precursor spinning coagulation process based on surrogate model",null,null,"2020 Chinese Automation Congress (CAC)",null,null,"10.1109/CAC51589.2020.9326779",null,"Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Conference","C","23","239","2399","High-quality carbon fiber precursor is the key to the manufacture of high-performance carbon fiber, and the coagulation process is one of the key steps in the preparation of the precursor.

In order to reduce the computational cost, a process optimization method for the coagulation process of carbon liber precursor spinning based on surrogate model was proposed. Using meta-modeling technology, this paper constructs the surrogate model which describes the relationship between the key operating parameters and the main output variables in the coagulation process. In the process of constructing the surrogate model, an evolutionary optimal sample point insertion criterion is adopted to improve the accuracy of the model. And the quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is applied for searching operating parameters in the design space.

How to control the traffic flow to mitigate the congestion has been one of the central issues in transportation research. In this study, we employ a quantum annealing approach to optimize the traffic signals control at a real-life intersection with mixed traffic flows of vehicles and scooters. Considering traffic flow is a continuous and emerging phenomenon, we used quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formalism for traffic optimization, which has a natural equivalence to the Ising model and can be solved efficiently on the quantum annealers, quantum computers or digital annealers. In this article, we first applied the QUBO traffic optimization to artificially generated traffic for a simple intersection, and then we used real-time traffic data to simulate a real \"Dongda-Keyuan\" intersection with dedicated cars and scooter lanes, as well as mixed scooter and car lanes. We introduced two types of traffic light control systems for traffic optimization: C-QUBO and QUBO. Our rigorous QUBO optimizations show that C-QUBO and QUBO outperform the commonly used fixed cycle method, with QUBO outperforming C-QUBO in some instances. It has been found that QUBO optimization significantly relieves traffic congestion for the unbalanced traffic volume. Furthermore, we found that dynamic changes in traffic light signal duration greatly reduce traffic congestion.","2021-11","5/3/2022 15:49","5/13/2022 22:06",null,"74-81",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"ISSN: 2693-8421",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\S84X95F3\\9704985.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\L2YQSACW\\9704985.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\3ZULA6CL\\Singh et al. - 2021 - Quantum Annealing Approach for the Optimal Real-ti.pdf",null,"included","Annealing; Quantum annealing; Urban areas; Motorcycles; Real-time systems; quantum computing; quantum annealing; Correlation; QUBO; real-time optimization; Roads; traffic optimization; traffic signal control",null,"2021 IEEE/ACIS 22nd International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD)","YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.75,0.8,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"C","Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Other transportation support activities"],["BJ2HEZHS","conferencePaper",2021,"Pushpabala, V.; ChristoberAsirRajan, C.","Energy Efficient Based Optimized Renewable Energy Systems (ORES) Using QPSO Technique for Normalized Cost of Energy (NCE)",null,null,"2021 International Conference on System, Computation, Automation and Networking (ICSCAN)",null,null,"10.1109/ICSCAN53069.2021.9526488",null,"Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Conference","D","35","351","3510","Numbers and charts of the world renewable energy agency and the International Energy Agency have lately shown that renewable energy sources (RES) have exceeded natural gas and have taken second place as a power source.

We examine a number of scenarios and compare the impact of communication latency on the intra-swarm and inter-swarm separations.","2020-09","5/4/2022 10:22","5/15/2022 20:57",null,"2G3-1-2G3-12",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"ISSN: 2155-4951",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\N982K4BP\\9223005.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\7VB7GKAT\\James et al. - 2020 - UAV Swarm Path Planning.pdf",null,"included","Computational modeling; Aircraft; Atmospheric modeling; Path planning; ATM; UTM; Autonomous aerial vehicles; Navigation; Surveillance; Swarm; UAV",null,"2020 Integrated Communications Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS)","NO",null,"YES",null,null,"YES","NO",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","NO","NO","NO","NO","YES",null,"NO",null,"YES","YES","NO","NO",null,"NO",0.5,0.230769231,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"Not assigned","Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Service activities incidental to air transportation"],["MXVUMVPM","conferencePaper",2021,"Henderson, Jessie M.; O\u2019Malley, Daniel; Viswanathan, Hari S.","Interrogating the performance of quantum annealing for the solution of steady-state subsurface flow",null,null,"2021 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)",null,null,"10.1109/HPEC49654.2021.9622819",null,"Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Conference","E","36","360","3600","In the 1990s, the principles of quantum mechanics were leveraged to describe how discrete combinatorial optimization problems could be solved using a method called quantum annealing.

In particular, we interrogate whether contemporary quantum annealers with more qubits, lower noise, and reverse annealing features can improve performance. We find modest improvements in speed and accuracy are possible; however, those benefits are currently constrained to a regime of very rapid, approximate solutions on small meshes. As quantum annealers continue to improve, we expect further encroachment on the performance of classical numerical solvers.","2021-09","5/4/2022 11:58","5/18/2022 11:56",null,"1-6",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"ISSN: 2643-1971",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\6PTUDJEA\\9622819.html;

We used a quantum representation of the solutions that allow the use of the original AMO version without discretization, as well as improving AMO by introducing chaotic map to determine the random numbers.

The results show that the QPSO algorithm can traverse and search for a task allocation plan with shorter path and less energy consumption for multiple AUV systems under the same constraints, so that the task allocation can reach the global optimal. Finally, in order to achieve the purpose of detecting the effectiveness of the algorithm, the simulation results are given in this paper.","2021-10","5/11/2022 16:20","5/13/2022 22:31",null,"4844-4849",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"ISSN: 2688-0938",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\W8SMRTCV\\9727785.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\2Y6MPEQI\\Pang et al. - 2021 - Task allocation for multi-AUV system under ocean c.pdf",null,"included","Energy consumption; Simulation; Resource management; Task analysis; Wave functions; Path planning; Kinematics constrains; Multi-autonomous underwater vehicle systems; Oceans; Quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO); Task allocation",null,"2021 China Automation Congress (CAC)","YES","NO","NO","YES",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.333333333,0.733333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"Not assigned","Professional, scientific and technical activities","Architectural and engineering activities; technical testing and analysis","Architectural and engineering activities and related technical consultancy","Architectural and engineering activities and related technical consultancy"],["GHUSTHSC","bookSection",2020,"Chiscop, Irina; Nauta, Jelle; Veerman, Bert; Phillipson, Frank","A Hybrid Solution Method for the Multi-Service Location Set Covering Problem",null,952.0,"Computational Science \u2013 ICCS 2020",null,null,"10.1007/978-3-030-50433-5_41","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128623258","Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Conference","O","84","841","8413","Abstract The Multi-Service Location Set Covering Problem is an extension of the well-known Set Covering Problem. It arises in practical applications where a set of physical locations need to be equipped with services to satisfy demand within a certain area, while minimizing costs. In this paper we formulate the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, apply the hybrid framework of the D-Wave quantum annealer to solve it, and investigate the feasibility of this approach. To improve the often suboptimal initial solutions found on the D-Wave system, we develop a hybrid quantum/classical optimization algorithm that starts from the seed solution and iteratively creates small subproblems that are more efficiently solved on the D-Wave but often still converge to feasible and improved solutions of the original problem. Finally we suggest some opportunities for increasing the accuracy and performance of our algorithm.","2020","5/11/2022 15:39","5/16/2022 14:41",null,"531-545",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-50433-5_41",null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.666666667,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"A","Public administration and defence;

Among others, an important goal is the minimization of the total transit time of the passengers. The corresponding objective function is quadratic in the binary decision variables encoding the flight-to-gate assignment. Hence, it is a quadratic assignment problem being hard to solve in general. In this work we investigate the solvability of this problem with a D-Wave quantum annealer. These machines are optimizers for quadratic unconstrained optimization problems (QUBO). Therefore the flight gate assignment problem seems to be well suited for these machines. We use real world data from a mid-sized German airport as well as simulation based data to extract typical instances small enough to be amenable to the D-Wave machine. In order to mitigate precision problems, we employ bin packing on the passenger numbers to reduce the precision requirements of the extracted instances. We find that, for the instances we investigated, the bin packing has little effect on the solution quality. Hence, we were able to solve small problem instances extracted from real data with the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer.","2019","4/25/2022 14:01","5/13/2022 22:04",null,"99-110",null,null,null,null,null,null,"Lecture Notes in Computer Science",null,null,null,"Springer International Publishing","Cham","en",null,null,null,null,"Springer Link",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\2MYGAWJY\\Stollenwerk et al. - 2019 - Flight Gate Assignment with a Quantum Annealer.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball","Quantum annealing; Airport planning; Quadratic assignment problem; QUBO","Feld, Sebastian; Linnhoff-Popien, Claudia",null,"NO",null,"YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES",null,"NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.571428571,0.642857143,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Service activities incidental to air transportation"]],"hovertemplate":"<b>S<sub>S</sub>: %{x}</b><br>S<sub>R</sub>: %{customdata[82]}<br>DOI: %{customdata[10]}","marker":{"outliercolor":"black"},"meanline":{"color":"black","visible":true},"name":"Workshop","points":"all","x":[0.571428571,0.571428571],"type":"violin"}],                        {"template":{"data":{"pie":[{"automargin":true,"type":"pie"}]},"layout":{"xaxis":{"showgrid":true,"title":{"standoff":15}},"yaxis":{"showgrid":true,"title":{"standoff":15}}}},"xaxis":{"range":[0,1],"title":{"text":"$S_S$"}},"yaxis":{"title":{"text":"Publication Source"},"dtick":1},"margin":{"l":100},"showlegend":false},                        {"responsive": true}                    )                };                            </script>        </div></div>

Here, CEED is represented using cubic criterion function to reduce the nonlinearities of the system. Along with economic load dispatch, emissions of SO2, NOx, and CO2 are considered as separate three objectives, thus making it a four-objective (many-objective) optimization problem. A unit-wise price penalty factor is considered here to convert all the objectives into a single objective in order to compare the final results with other previously used methods like Lagrangian relaxation (LR), particle swarm optimization, and simulated annealing. QBA is applied in six-unit power generation system for four different loads. The obtained results show QBA successfully solve many-objective CEED problem with greater superiority than other methods found in the literature in terms of quality results, robustness, and computational performance. In the end of this paper, a detailed future research direction is provided based on the simulation results and its analysis.

The DEMD method is employed to decompose the electric load to several detail parts associated with high frequencies (intrinsic mode function-IMF) and an approximate part associated with low frequencies.

In reality, demand of a certain product becomes highly effected by on-hand stock level in stores and the selling price of the product. In the proposed model, demand of the product is dependent on these two vital deceive factors. In real life production systems, always there are some defective products which requires reworking in order to make them useful. The possibility of producing some defective items in regular production process and their reworking has been taken into account in the model. In case of inventories of highly demandable products, it is observed that production rate is proportional to demand. The situation also arises in case of launching a new product or in a multi-stage production system. In this model, production rate is a variable and it varies with the demand rate. Shortages are allowed and it is backlogged fully. Based on these assumptions, several researchers worked on but they considered that the associated inventory cost parameters are fixed real numbers. However, these are not fixed in reality and may vary time to time depending upon some scenario. Main objective of the paper is to develop a production inventory model under those assumptions considering various cost parameters as interval numbers. As a result the corresponding optimization problem is also interval valued. Quantum behaved particle swarm optimization technique has been applied to find the maximum profit in a single cycle. Numerical example and sensitivity analysis are given to illustrate the proposed inventory model.  2019, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.","2020","4/11/2022 15:14","5/4/2022 11:23",null,"385-399",null,"2","11",null,"International Journal of Systems Assurance Engineering and Management",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Publisher: Springer",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\TY5WT3EX\\Ruidas et al. - 2020 - An EPQ model with stock and selling price dependen.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13198-019-00867-w","Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Numerical methods; Sensitivity analysis; Inventory control; Defects; included; reverse snowball; forward snowball",null,null,null,"NO",null,"NO","YES",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.25,0.857142857,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q3",0.3,null,"Manufacturing","Manufacture of leather and related products","Tanning and dressing of leather; manufacture of luggage, handbags, saddlery and harness; dressing and dyeing of fur","Manufacture of luggage, handbags and the like, saddlery and harness"],["EEM6Q2MC","journalArticle",2020,"Wang, Yongli; Song, Fuhao; Ma, Yuze; Zhang, Yuli; Yang, Jiale; Liu, Yang; Zhang, Fuwei; Zhu, Jinrong","Research on capacity planning and optimization of regional integrated energy system based on hybrid energy storage system",13688.0,null,"Applied Thermal Engineering",null,"1359-4311","10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2020.115834","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359431120333160","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Genetic Algorithm",null,null,"Journal","D","35","351","3510","Some regional integrated energy systems (RIES) have installed equipments such as wind turbine and photovoltaic, but the fluctuation of these intermittent power supply is large, resulting in a certain amount of energy waste. Because energy storage can improve the utilization rate of renewable energy, this paper establishes a storage capacity expansion planning model considering multiple functions of hybrid energy storage in the RIES. In this model, the wavelet packet decomposition method is used to reasonably decompose the high-frequency fluctuation and low-frequency fluctuation of renewable energy to achieve the function of stabilizing fluctuation. Meanwhile, an operation strategy for hybrid energy storage to participate in demand response is proposed. Rain flow counting method is used to research the life of hybrid energy storage system, which improves the accuracy of energy storage annual cost calculation. In the Simulation and Analysis section, the genetic quantum algorithm is used for simulation and analysis of the role and benefits of hybrid energy storage. The simulation results show that the benefit of hybrid energy storage in capacity expansion construction is increased by 10.4%, and when the electricity and gas prices fluctuate by \u00b120%, the hybrid energy storage configuration proposed in this paper has a stable advantage in more than 95%.","2020-11-05","4/11/2022 15:14","5/3/2022 17:35",null,"115834",null,null,"180",null,"Applied Thermal Engineering",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\R7X7P2WV\\Wang et al. - 2020 - Research on capacity planning and optimization of .pdf",null,"Hybrid energy storage;

Most often software product developments are iterative and incremental in their nature, due to the changes in the customer requirements from time to time. It is a challenging task to select the requirements from a large number of candidates, for the accomplishment of the business goals. The problem is to identify a set of requirements to be included in the next release of the product, by minimizing the cost and maximizing the customer satisfaction. Since minimizing the total cost and maximizing the customer satisfaction are contradictory objectives, the problem has a multi-objective nature. This problem is NP-hard in its nature and so it cannot be solved efficiently by using traditional optimization techniques for large problem instances. QEMEA combines the best features of Evolutionary Algorithms and Quantum Computing. It employs the concepts of Quantum computing such as superposition and interference.

In order to reduce the computational cost, a process optimization method for the coagulation process of carbon liber precursor spinning based on surrogate model was proposed. Using meta-modeling technology, this paper constructs the surrogate model which describes the relationship between the key operating parameters and the main output variables in the coagulation process. In the process of constructing the surrogate model, an evolutionary optimal sample point insertion criterion is adopted to improve the accuracy of the model.

A quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization (QPSO) technique is presented in this paper to solve many-objective environmental economic dispatch (EED) problems. Emissions of CO2, SO2, and NOx are considered 3 different objectives, thus making it a 4-objective problem considering ED. Many-objective EED problems are defined by using a cubic criterion function, and a max/max price penalty factor is considered to convert all the objectives into a single objective to compare the final results with other well-known methods found in the literature like Lagrangian relaxation, particle swarm optimization, simulated annealing, and quantum-behaved bat algorithm. Quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization is implemented on a 6-unit system to solve many-objective EED problems, and at the same time, to show the effectiveness of QPSO in large systems, it is also implemented in a 26-unit power generation system for ED problem.

How to control the traffic flow to mitigate the congestion has been one of the central issues in transportation research. In this study, we employ a quantum annealing approach to optimize the traffic signals control at a real-life intersection with mixed traffic flows of vehicles and scooters. Considering traffic flow is a continuous and emerging phenomenon, we used quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formalism for traffic optimization, which has a natural equivalence to the Ising model and can be solved efficiently on the quantum annealers, quantum computers or digital annealers. In this article, we first applied the QUBO traffic optimization to artificially generated traffic for a simple intersection, and then we used real-time traffic data to simulate a real \"Dongda-Keyuan\" intersection with dedicated cars and scooter lanes, as well as mixed scooter and car lanes. We introduced two types of traffic light control systems for traffic optimization: C-QUBO and QUBO. Our rigorous QUBO optimizations show that C-QUBO and QUBO outperform the commonly used fixed cycle method, with QUBO outperforming C-QUBO in some instances. It has been found that QUBO optimization significantly relieves traffic congestion for the unbalanced traffic volume.

This article provides a technique for optimising electricity produced by an example of the need for loads as the load of typical buildings to meet an ORES. Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization Technique (QPSO) is used as an algorithm to search for optimisation because of its advantages compared with other methods to reduce the standardised costs of energy, between production and demand taking account of losses;defined the problem and introduce the objective function with fitness in mind. The structure of the algorithm was created with MATLAB software.","2021-07","5/3/2022 15:59","5/13/2022 22:24",null,"1-6",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\5CIZTSVW\\9526488.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\UM25NMVS\\Pushpabala and ChristoberAsirRajan - 2021 - Energy Efficient Based Optimized Renewable Energy .pdf",null,"included","Costs; Renewable energy sources; Software algorithms; Search problems; Sensitivity; Optimization methods; Production; Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization; Normalized Cost of Energy; Optimized Renewable Energy Systems; Renewable Energy Sources",null,"2021 International Conference on System, Computation, Automation and Networking (ICSCAN)","YES","NO","NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","NO","NO","YES","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","NO",null,"NO",0.444444444,0.4,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"Not assigned","Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution"],["Q6HA4KL8","journalArticle",2020,"Wang, Ziteng; Hu, Zhiyuan; Tang, Yuanjie","Float-Based Resource Leveling Optimization of Linear Projects",21100374601.0,null,"IEEE Access",null,null,"10.1109/access.2020.3027058","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131293130","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","F","41","410","4100","In recent years, the linear scheduling method (LSM) approach to the linear project scheduling optimization problem has been widely studied by researchers. In this paper, the problem of resource leveling of linear projects under the framework of LSM is studied. Firstly, the concept of a third type of float is proposed, and the advantages of this third type of float to the optimization of linear project resource leveling are analyzed. On this basis, a two-stage optimization process of the linear project resource leveling problem based on the third type of float is proposed. The process takes into account new constraints such as total resource constraint, resource utilization constraint, and construction mileage constraint, and it aims to maximize the space-time flexibility of construction activities and realize the depth optimization of linear project resource leveling. According to the integer nonlinear characteristic of the model, a quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm with a constraint processing mechanism and particle search range restriction is designed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model is verified by case analysis and comparison of the results in previous studies.","2020","5/3/2022 16:13","5/15/2022 18:51",null,"176997-177020",null,null,"8",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\AGUAJ3LJ\\9207731.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\FPWAKFEV\\Wang et al. - 2020 - Float-Based Resource Leveling Optimization of Line.pdf",null,"included","Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; project management; Resource management; Schedules; Optimal scheduling; Acceleration; Linear project; optimal scheduling; quantum particle swarm; resource leveling",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.666666667,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",0.587,null,"Construction","Construction of buildings","Construction of buildings","Construction of buildings"],["HZBHE4J5","journalArticle",2021,"Guo, Yuxue; Xu, Yue-Ping; Sun, Mengcheng; Xie, Jingkai","Multi-step-ahead forecast of reservoir water availability with improved quantum-based GWO coupled with the AI-based LSSVM model",50089.0,null,"Journal of Hydrology",null,null,"10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125769","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132664940","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum-based Grey Wolf Optimizer",null,null,"Journal","E","36","360","3600","It remains a challenge to obtain an accurate multi-step-ahead forecast of reservoir water availability for island areas. A novel hybrid multi-step-ahead forecast model is introduced to solve this problem. Partial autocorrelation function (PACF) is first used to analyze the characteristics of the target time series for extracting the appropriate input variables. Least-square support vector machine (LSSVM) with recursive mechanism is then explored for modelling multi-step-ahead forecasts, in which the forecast model is adjusted adaptively as long as new information is updated. The parameters in LSSVM are optimized based on an improved quantum-inspired version of Grey Wolf Optimizer (QGWO). The QGWO fortifies against the stagnation of the wolves at an optimal local point using three strategies including the quantum operator, non-linear convergence factor, and dynamic weighting. In this paper, the performance of QGWO was first demonstrated with that of other meta-heuristic (MH) algorithms in solving eight mathematical benchmark problems. Two time series of reservoir water availability in Zhoushan Islands, China, were then provided and analyzed to validate the performance of the advanced forecast approach in multi-step-ahead forecasts. The forecasts were compared with those obtained by the non-adaptive (NA) and non-recursive (NR) models. Results indicate that (1) QGWO displays superior performance on model parameters optimization than other comparative MH algorithms; (2) The proposed hybrid model in consideration of the nearest anterior feedback, as well as the adaptive mechanism, not only outperforms the two comparative models (NA, NR) but significantly enhances the accuracy of multi-step-ahead forecasts for non-stationary time series and low or high volume events, even as the forecast time horizon increases.","2021","5/3/2022 16:13","5/15/2022 16:40",null,"125769",null,null,"597",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\IUR5G3PH\\Guo et al. - 2021 - Multi-step-ahead forecast of reservoir water avail.pdf",null,"included","Adaptive and recursive mechanism; Island areas; Multi-step-ahead forecast; Quantum Grey Wolf Optimizer (QGWO); Reservoir water availability",null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.75,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",1.611,null,"Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities","Water collection, treatment and supply","Water collection, treatment and supply","Water collection, treatment and supply"],["DQ54M769","journalArticle",2021,"Bodha, Kapil Deo; Yadav, Vinod Kumar; Mukherjee, Vivekananda","A novel quantum inspired hybrid metaheuristic for dispatch of power system including solar photovoltaic generation",4700152713.0,null,"Energy Sources, Part B: Economics, Planning, and Policy",null,null,"10.1080/15567249.2021.1933265","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138664786","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum-inspired Binary TVIW-GSA-PSO",null,null,"Journal","D","35","351","3510","This manuscript proposes a novel metaheuristic, which is an amalgamation of the quantum concept and the gravitational search particle swarm optimization technique.

In this paper, in order to comprehensively considere different stakeholders, a three-objective gate allocation model is to consider a wider scope, in which the minimizing passenger walking distances, the most balanced idle time of each gate and the best full use of large gate are optimized simultaneously to improve the practical efficiency. To efficiently solve this model, an improved quantum evolutionary algorithm (QEA) based on the niche co-evolution strategy and enhanced particle swarm optimization (PSO), namely IPOQEA is designed. An IPOQEA-based gate allocation method is proposed to allocate the flights to suitable gates within different periods. Finally, the actual operation data of Baiyun Airport is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Comparison results show that the constructed model can address the passenger walking distances, robustness and costs in airport management. Moreover, the IPOQEA has better optimization ability in solving gate allocation problem. Therefore, the proposed gate allocation method has great potential for practical engineering since it can easily make decisions for airport managers.","2022-03","5/4/2022 10:25","5/13/2022 21:03",null,"1737-1745",null,"3","23",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\SD597D35\\9210735.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\AVL4TNSW\\Deng et al. - 2022 - A Novel Gate Resource Allocation Method Using Impr.pdf",null,"included","Optimization; Logic gates; Airports; Resource management; Statistics; Sociology; Atmospheric modeling; Gate allocation model; improved rotation gates; multi-objective; niche co-evolution strategy; PSO; QEA",null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.75,0.6,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Not assigned","Not assigned",null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Service activities incidental to air transportation"],["5VPSAUHF","journalArticle",2021,"Ruidas, Subhendu; Seikh, Mijanur Rahaman; Nayak, Prasun Kumar","A production inventory model with interval-valued carbon emission parameters under price-sensitive demand",18164.0,null,"Computers & Industrial Engineering",null,"0360-8352","10.1016/j.cie.2021.107154","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360835221000589","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","M","70","701","7010","As environmental pollution has become a serious problem in recent years, production firms have now shifted their attention to lower the carbon emission level along with their financial goal. Now, one major drawback of the available models is that they consider the amount of carbon emission associated with various inventory processes like setup process, production process, inventory holding process, etc. as fixed numbers. However, these quantities may not be fixed in reality due to several factors, like the condition of the carbon filtrating apparatus in the production firm, machine breakdown, quality of the raw material, nature of the fuel or energy used, etc. The parameters may vary in between some certain ranges. This paper aims at developing an imperfect production inventory model under the various carbon emission regulatory policies where the various carbon emission parameters are interval numbers. The various inventory cost parameters are also represented as interval numbers to reflect the practical situation. The demand of the product is assumed to be a linearly decreasing function of the selling price of the product. Also, the idea of a new inventory cost component, referred to as the \u2018development cost\u2019 is introduced. Four different policies- simple tax policy, cap and purchase policy, cap and reward policy and strictly under permitted cap policy are discussed, and based on those policies four different inventory models are developed. The Quantum behaved Particle Swarm Optimization(QPSO) algorithm has been applied to find the optimal profit of the manufacturer. The optimal profit obtained here is also an interval number which is quite realistic. The traditional fuzzy or probabilistic approach to represent impreciseness fails to find such kind of solution. A numerical example for every case has been given to illustrate the applicability of the models. Finally, sensitivity analysis of the optimal feasible solution due to variation in some key parameters has been provided with the key managerial insights.","2021-04-01","5/4/2022 11:21","5/18/2022 11:46","5/4/2022 11:21","107154",null,null,"154",null,"Computers & Industrial Engineering",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"en",null,null,null,null,"ScienceDirect",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\ISRLT4XK\\Ruidas et al. - 2021 - A production inventory model with interval-valued .pdf",null,"included","Sustainable production;

In this paper, we propose an improved quantum chaotic animal migration optimization algorithm to solve the multicast routing problem (Multi-Constrained Least Cost MCLC). We used a quantum representation of the solutions that allow the use of the original AMO version without discretization, as well as improving AMO by introducing chaotic map to determine the random numbers. These two contributions improve the diversification and intensification of the algorithm. The simulation results show that our proposed algorithm has a good scalability and efficiency compared with other existing algorithms in the literature.","2018","5/4/2022 12:34","5/16/2022 19:11",null,"128-139",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-89743-1_12",null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.777777778,0.733333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"Not assigned","Information and communication","Information service activities","Data processing, hosting and related activities;

The analyses suggest that the good solutions are clustered in the search space and there is a correlation between the \ufb01tness of a local optimum and its distance to the best solution. Inspired by these \ufb01ndings, a new operator for Quantum Evolutionary Algorithms is proposed which, during the search process, collects information about the \ufb01tness landscape and tried to capture the backbone structure of the landscape. The knowledge it has collected is used to guide the search process towards a better region in the search space. The proposed algorithm consists of two phases. The \ufb01rst phase uses a tabu mechanism to collect information about the \ufb01tness landscape. In the second phase, the collected data are processed to guide the algorithm towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm clusters the good solutions it has found in its previous search process. Then when the population is converged and trapped in a local optimum, it is divided into sub-populations and each sub-population is designated to a cluster. The information in the database is then used to reinitialize the q-individuals, so they represent better regions in the search space. This way the population maintains diversity and by capturing the \ufb01tness landscape structure, the algorithm is guided towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm is compared with some state-ofthe-art algorithms from PATAT competition conferences and experimental results are presented.","2021-04","5/4/2022 14:30","5/13/2022 22:40","5/4/2022 14:30","114211",null,null,"168",null,"Expert Systems with Applications","How to exploit fitness landscape properties of timetabling problem",null,null,null,null,null,null,"en",null,null,null,null,"DOI.org (Crossref)",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\AKDUX97Q\\Najaran - 2021 - How to exploit fitness landscape properties of tim.pdf",null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.875,0.6,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",2.07,null,"Professional, scientific and technical activities","Activities of head offices;

Focusing on this problem, this paper has carried out a study on the multi-objective configuration optimization method (COM) and energy management strategy (EMS) for ship hybrid energy systems based on quantum computing. First, the mathematical model of distributed power modules of the hybrid energy system is established, and a configuration optimization objective function that aims at low-cost, long equipment life, and high reliability of power supply is constructed. Then, the combination with fuzzy rules and quantum multi-objective artificial bee colony algorithm to solve the objective function, the configuration scheme satisfying multiple constraints is obtained. On this basis, an energy management optimization objective function that meets both low-cost operation and maximum clean energy utilization for ship electric power system is established, an objective function is optimized in multi-objective quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm, the real-time optimal scheduling for hybrid energy systems of the ship is realized. Experiments on actual navigation data verify the feasibility of the multi-objective configuration optimization method using the quantum artificial bee colony (QABC) algorithm.

The quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is used to obtain the energy-optimal solutions. The energy-optimal solutions are used as the initial values for the homotopic procedure to obtain the fuel-optimal solutions and optimal bang-bang control law.

The bat algorithm (BA) is an acknowledged metaheuristic optimization algorithm owing to its performance. However, the classical BA presents some weaknesses, such as premature convergence. To withstand the drawbacks of the BA, quantum mechanics theories and Gaussian and Cauchy operators are integrated into the standard BA to enhance its effectiveness. Since the economic load dispatch is a nonlinear, complex and constrained optimization problem, its main objective is to reduce the total generation cost while matching the equality and inequality constraints of the system. The validity of the CGQBA is tested on six standard benchmark functions with different characteristics. The numerical results indicate that the CGQBA is effective and superior to many other algorithms. Moreover, the CGQBA is applied to solve the ELD problems on various test systems including 3,6,20, 40,110 and 160 implemented generating units. The simulation results illustrate the strength of the CGQBA compared with other algorithms recently reported in the literature.","2021","5/11/2022 14:23","5/13/2022 22:09",null,"3207-3228",null,null,"9",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.777777778,0.733333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",0.927,null,"Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution"],["6ZTAZZTA","conferencePaper",2021,"Soyinka Olukunle, K.; Nwanze, Nzekwu; Akoma Henry, E.

The results show that the QPSO algorithm can traverse and search for a task allocation plan with shorter path and less energy consumption for multiple AUV systems under the same constraints, so that the task allocation can reach the global optimal. Finally, in order to achieve the purpose of detecting the effectiveness of the algorithm, the simulation results are given in this paper.","2021-10","5/11/2022 16:20","5/13/2022 22:31",null,"4844-4849",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"ISSN: 2688-0938",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\W8SMRTCV\\9727785.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\2Y6MPEQI\\Pang et al. - 2021 - Task allocation for multi-AUV system under ocean c.pdf",null,"included","Energy consumption; Simulation; Resource management; Task analysis; Wave functions; Path planning; Kinematics constrains; Multi-autonomous underwater vehicle systems; Oceans; Quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO); Task allocation",null,"2021 China Automation Congress (CAC)","YES","NO","NO","YES",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.333333333,0.733333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"Not assigned","Professional, scientific and technical activities","Architectural and engineering activities; technical testing and analysis","Architectural and engineering activities and related technical consultancy","Architectural and engineering activities and related technical consultancy"],["XSXK47A5","journalArticle",2019,"Chen, Xihui; Ji, Aimin; Cheng, Gang","A Novel Deep Feature Learning Method Based on the Fused-Stacked AEs for Planetary Gear Fault Diagnosis",62932.0,null,"Energies",null,"1996-1073","10.3390/en12234522","https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/12/23/4522","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Ant Colony Algorithm",null,null,"Journal","C","33","331","3312","Planetary gear is the key component of the transmission system of electromechanical equipment for energy industry, and it is easy to damage, which affects the reliability and operation efficiency of electromechanical equipment of energy industry. Therefore, it is of great significance to extract the useful fault features and diagnose faults based on raw vibration signals. In this paper, a novel deep feature learning method based on the fused-stacked autoencoders (AEs) for planetary gear fault diagnosis was proposed. First, to improve the data learning ability and the robustness of feature extraction process of AE model, the sparse autoencoder (SAE) and the contractive autoencoder (CAE) were studied, respectively. Then, the quantum ant colony algorithm (QACA) was used to optimize the specific location and key parameters of SAEs and CAEs in deep learning architecture, and multiple SAEs and multiple CAEs were stacked alternately to form a novel deep learning architecture, which gave the deep learning architecture better data learning ability and robustness of feature extraction. The experimental results show that the proposed method can address the raw vibration signals of planetary gear. Compared with other deep learning architectures and shallow learning architecture, the proposed method has better diagnosis performance, and it is an effective method of deep feature learning and fault diagnosis.","2019-01","5/11/2022 15:42","5/16/2022 18:44","5/11/2022 15:42","4522",null,"23","12",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",null,null,null,"www.mdpi.com",null,"Number: 23 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\NBX76F2T\\Chen et al. - 2019 - A Novel Deep Feature Learning Method Based on the .pdf;

It was only recently that small but functional quantum computers have become available on the cloud, allowing to test their potential. In this paper we propose to leverage their capabilities to address an important task for recommender systems providers, the optimal selection of recommendation carousels. In many video-on-demand and music streaming services the user is provided with a homepage containing several recommendation lists, i.e., carousels, each built with a certain criteria (e.g., artist, mood, Action movies etc.). Choosing which set of carousels to display is a difficult problem because it needs to account for how the different recommendation lists interact, e.g., avoiding duplicate recommendations, and how they help the user explore the catalogue. We focus in particular on the adiabatic computing paradigm and use the D-Wave quantum annealer, which is able to solve NP-hard optimization problems, can be programmed by classical operations research tools and is freely available on the cloud. We propose a formulation of the carousel selection problem for black box recommenders, that can be solved effectively on a quantum annealer and has the advantage of being simple.

We show that time-critical optimization tasks, such as continuous redistribution of position data for cars in dense road networks, are suitable candidates for quantum computing.

However the resulting spin configurations are not always in the ground state. It can rather quickly generate many spin configurations following the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution. In the present study, we formulate an Ising model to control a large number of automated guided vehicles in a factory without collision.

In this work we investigate the solvability of this problem with a D-Wave quantum annealer. These machines are optimizers for quadratic unconstrained optimization problems (QUBO). Therefore the flight gate assignment problem seems to be well suited for these machines. We use real world data from a mid-sized German airport as well as simulation based data to extract typical instances small enough to be amenable to the D-Wave machine. In order to mitigate precision problems, we employ bin packing on the passenger numbers to reduce the precision requirements of the extracted instances. We find that, for the instances we investigated, the bin packing has little effect on the solution quality. Hence, we were able to solve small problem instances extracted from real data with the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer.","2019","4/25/2022 14:01","5/13/2022 22:04",null,"99-110",null,null,null,null,null,null,"Lecture Notes in Computer Science",null,null,null,"Springer International Publishing","Cham","en",null,null,null,null,"Springer Link",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\2MYGAWJY\\Stollenwerk et al. - 2019 - Flight Gate Assignment with a Quantum Annealer.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball","Quantum annealing; Airport planning; Quadratic assignment problem; QUBO","Feld, Sebastian; Linnhoff-Popien, Claudia",null,"NO",null,"YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES",null,"NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.571428571,0.642857143,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Service activities incidental to air transportation"],["VC9K5BV6","journalArticle",2020,"Stollenwerk, Tobias; O\u2019Gorman, Bryan; Venturelli, Davide; Mandr\u00e0, Salvatore; Rodionova, Olga; Ng, Hokkwan; Sridhar, Banavar; Rieffel, Eleanor Gilbert; Biswas, Rupak","Quantum Annealing Applied to De-Conflicting Optimal Trajectories for Air Traffic Management",18378.0,null,"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems",null,"1558-0016","10.1109/TITS.2019.2891235",null,"Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Journal","H","52","522","5223","We present the mapping of a class of simplified air traffic management problems (strategic conflict resolution) to quadratic unconstrained Boolean optimization problems.

We examine a number of scenarios and compare the impact of communication latency on the intra-swarm and inter-swarm separations.","2020-09","5/4/2022 10:22","5/15/2022 20:57",null,"2G3-1-2G3-12",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"ISSN: 2155-4951",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\N982K4BP\\9223005.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\7VB7GKAT\\James et al. - 2020 - UAV Swarm Path Planning.pdf",null,"included","Computational modeling; Aircraft; Atmospheric modeling; Path planning; ATM; UTM; Autonomous aerial vehicles; Navigation; Surveillance; Swarm; UAV",null,"2020 Integrated Communications Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS)","NO",null,"YES",null,null,"YES","NO",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","NO","NO","NO","NO","YES",null,"NO",null,"YES","YES","NO","NO",null,"NO",0.5,0.230769231,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"Not assigned","Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Service activities incidental to air transportation"],["B7QM3W94","journalArticle",2019,"Ikeda, Kazuki; Nakamura, Yuma; Humble, Travis S.","Application of Quantum Annealing to Nurse Scheduling Problem",21100200805.0,null,"Scientific Reports",null,null,"10.1038/s41598-019-49172-3","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120878833","Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Journal","Q","86","861","8610","Quantum annealing is a promising heuristic method to solve combinatorial optimization problems, and efforts to quantify performance on real-world problems provide insights into how this approach may be best used in practice. We investigate the empirical performance of quantum annealing to solve the Nurse Scheduling Problem (NSP) with hard constraints using the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealing device. NSP seeks the optimal assignment for a set of nurses to shifts under an accompanying set of constraints on schedule and personnel. After reducing NSP to a novel Ising-type Hamiltonian, we evaluate the solution quality obtained from the D-Wave 2000Q against the constraint requirements as well as the diversity of solutions. For the test problems explored here, our results indicate that quantum annealing recovers satisfying solutions for NSP and suggests the heuristic method is potentially achievable for practical use. Moreover, we observe that solution quality can be greatly improved through the use of reverse annealing, in which it is possible to refine returned results by using the annealing process a second time. We compare the performance of NSP using both forward and reverse annealing methods and describe how this approach might be used in practice.","2019","5/4/2022 10:49","5/16/2022 16:18",null,"12837",null,"1","9",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.555555556,0.733333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",1.341,null,"Human health and social work activities","Human health activities","Hospital activities","Hospital activities"],["MXVUMVPM","conferencePaper",2021,"Henderson, Jessie M.; O\u2019Malley, Daniel; Viswanathan, Hari S.","Interrogating the performance of quantum annealing for the solution of steady-state subsurface flow",null,null,"2021 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)",null,null,"10.1109/HPEC49654.2021.9622819",null,"Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Conference","E","36","360","3600","In the 1990s, the principles of quantum mechanics were leveraged to describe how discrete combinatorial optimization problems could be solved using a method called quantum annealing.

Inspired by strong non-linear learning capability of support vector regression (SVR), this paper presents an SVR model hybridized with the differential empirical mode decomposition (DEMD) method and quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm (QPSO) for electric load forecasting. The DEMD method is employed to decompose the electric load to several detail parts associated with high frequencies (intrinsic mode function-IMF) and an approximate part associated with low frequencies. Hybridized with quantum theory to enhance particle searching performance, the so-called QPSO is used to optimize the parameters of SVR. The electric load data of the New South Wales (Sydney, Australia) market and the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO, New York, USA) are used for comparing the forecasting performances of different forecasting models. The results illustrate the validity of the idea that the proposed model can simultaneously provide forecasting with good accuracy and interpretability.","2016-03","4/11/2022 15:14","5/12/2022 16:15",null,"221 (20 pp.)",null,"3","9",null,"Energies",null,"Energies (Switzerland)",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Place: Switzerland Publisher: MDPI AG",null,"; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\S9Y5ZW9B\\Li-Ling Peng et al. - 2016 - Hybridizing DEMD and Quantum PSO with SVR in Elect.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en9030221","regression analysis; load forecasting; particle swarm optimisation; support vector machines; included; reverse snowball; forward snowball",null,null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.75,0.866666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",0.662,null,"Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution"],["KQ92FIRT","journalArticle",2020,"Ruidas, Subhendu; Seikh, Mijanur Rahaman; Nayak, Prasun Kumar","An EPQ model with stock and selling price dependent demand and variable production rate in interval environment",19700177002.0,null,"International Journal of Systems Assurance Engineering and Management",null,"09756809","10.1007/s13198-019-00867-w",null,"Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","C","15","151","1512","The motto of this paper is to develop a production inventory model in real life situation. In reality, demand of a certain product becomes highly effected by on-hand stock level in stores and the selling price of the product. In the proposed model, demand of the product is dependent on these two vital deceive factors. In real life production systems, always there are some defective products which requires reworking in order to make them useful. The possibility of producing some defective items in regular production process and their reworking has been taken into account in the model. In case of inventories of highly demandable products, it is observed that production rate is proportional to demand. The situation also arises in case of launching a new product or in a multi-stage production system. In this model, production rate is a variable and it varies with the demand rate. Shortages are allowed and it is backlogged fully. Based on these assumptions, several researchers worked on but they considered that the associated inventory cost parameters are fixed real numbers. However, these are not fixed in reality and may vary time to time depending upon some scenario. Main objective of the paper is to develop a production inventory model under those assumptions considering various cost parameters as interval numbers. As a result the corresponding optimization problem is also interval valued. Quantum behaved particle swarm optimization technique has been applied to find the maximum profit in a single cycle. Numerical example and sensitivity analysis are given to illustrate the proposed inventory model.  2019, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.","2020","4/11/2022 15:14","5/4/2022 11:23",null,"385-399",null,"2","11",null,"International Journal of Systems Assurance Engineering and Management",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Publisher: Springer",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\TY5WT3EX\\Ruidas et al. - 2020 - An EPQ model with stock and selling price dependen.pdf;

The route planning for UAV on the sea is formulated as an optimization problem. A simple method of pretreatment to the terrain environment is proposed. A novel route planner for UAV is designed to generate a safe and flyable path in the presence of different threat environments based on the DEQPSO algorithm.

In order to reduce the computational cost, a process optimization method for the coagulation process of carbon liber precursor spinning based on surrogate model was proposed. Using meta-modeling technology, this paper constructs the surrogate model which describes the relationship between the key operating parameters and the main output variables in the coagulation process.

In order to solve the problem of environmental economic dispatch (EED), this paper proposes a DE-CQPSO (Differential Evolution-Crossover Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization) algorithm based on the fast convergence of differential evolution algorithms and the particle diversity of crossover operators of genetic algorithms. In order to obtain better optimization results, a parameter adaptive control method is used to update the crossover probability. And the problem of multi-objective optimization is solved by introducing a penalty factor. The experimental results show that: the evaluation index and convergence speed of the DE-CQPSO algorithm are better than QPSO (Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization) and other algorithms, whether it is single-objective optimization of fuel cost and emissions or multi-objective optimization considering both optimization objectives. A good compromise value is verified, which verifies the effectiveness and robustness of the DE-CQPSO algorithm in solving environmental economic dispatch problems.

Economic dispatch problem refers to the minimization of generation cost, where environmental dispatch problem refers to the minimization of emission of pollutants like CO2, SO2, and NOx from the power generation system. A quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization (QPSO) technique is presented in this paper to solve many-objective environmental economic dispatch (EED) problems. Emissions of CO2, SO2, and NOx are considered 3 different objectives, thus making it a 4-objective problem considering ED. Many-objective EED problems are defined by using a cubic criterion function, and a max/max price penalty factor is considered to convert all the objectives into a single objective to compare the final results with other well-known methods found in the literature like Lagrangian relaxation, particle swarm optimization, simulated annealing, and quantum-behaved bat algorithm. Quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization is implemented on a 6-unit system to solve many-objective EED problems, and at the same time, to show the effectiveness of QPSO in large systems, it is also implemented in a 26-unit power generation system for ED problem. The obtained results demonstrate and verify the effectiveness and robustness of QPSO to solve many-objective EED problems. This also shows that QPSO can effectively be implemented in such power dispatch problems.","2018","4/27/2022 16:24","5/11/2022 15:55","4/27/2022 16:24","e2497",null,"3","28",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"en",null,null,null,null,"Wiley Online Library",null,"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/etep.2497",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\RKHCJZ95\\Mahdi et al. - 2018 - A quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization app.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball","quantum particle swarm optimization; economic load dispatch; cubic criterion function; emission reduction; environmental economic dispatch; many-objective optimization; max/max penalty factor",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.666666667,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q2",0.453,null,"Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution"],["F3TGSW3M","journalArticle",2014,"Hosseinnezhad, Vahid; Rafiee, Mansour; Ahmadian, Mohammad; Ameli, Mohammad Taghi","Species-based Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization for economic load dispatch",17985.0,null,"International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems",null,"0142-0615","10.1016/j.ijepes.2014.05.066","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142061514003378","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","D","35","351","3510","Economic load dispatch (ELD) is one of the important optimization problems in the operation of power systems which can be helpful to create effective generating management plans.

On this basis, a two-stage optimization process of the linear project resource leveling problem based on the third type of float is proposed. The process takes into account new constraints such as total resource constraint, resource utilization constraint, and construction mileage constraint, and it aims to maximize the space-time flexibility of construction activities and realize the depth optimization of linear project resource leveling.

Now, one major drawback of the available models is that they consider the amount of carbon emission associated with various inventory processes like setup process, production process, inventory holding process, etc. as fixed numbers. However, these quantities may not be fixed in reality due to several factors, like the condition of the carbon filtrating apparatus in the production firm, machine breakdown, quality of the raw material, nature of the fuel or energy used, etc. The parameters may vary in between some certain ranges. This paper aims at developing an imperfect production inventory model under the various carbon emission regulatory policies where the various carbon emission parameters are interval numbers. The various inventory cost parameters are also represented as interval numbers to reflect the practical situation. The demand of the product is assumed to be a linearly decreasing function of the selling price of the product. Also, the idea of a new inventory cost component, referred to as the \u2018development cost\u2019 is introduced. Four different policies- simple tax policy, cap and purchase policy, cap and reward policy and strictly under permitted cap policy are discussed, and based on those policies four different inventory models are developed. The Quantum behaved Particle Swarm Optimization(QPSO) algorithm has been applied to find the optimal profit of the manufacturer. The optimal profit obtained here is also an interval number which is quite realistic. The traditional fuzzy or probabilistic approach to represent impreciseness fails to find such kind of solution. A numerical example for every case has been given to illustrate the applicability of the models. Finally, sensitivity analysis of the optimal feasible solution due to variation in some key parameters has been provided with the key managerial insights.","2021-04-01","5/4/2022 11:21","5/18/2022 11:46","5/4/2022 11:21","107154",null,null,"154",null,"Computers & Industrial Engineering",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"en",null,null,null,null,"ScienceDirect",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\ISRLT4XK\\Ruidas et al. - 2021 - A production inventory model with interval-valued .pdf",null,"included","Sustainable production;

Focusing on this problem, this paper has carried out a study on the multi-objective configuration optimization method (COM) and energy management strategy (EMS) for ship hybrid energy systems based on quantum computing. First, the mathematical model of distributed power modules of the hybrid energy system is established, and a configuration optimization objective function that aims at low-cost, long equipment life, and high reliability of power supply is constructed. Then, the combination with fuzzy rules and quantum multi-objective artificial bee colony algorithm to solve the objective function, the configuration scheme satisfying multiple constraints is obtained. On this basis, an energy management optimization objective function that meets both low-cost operation and maximum clean energy utilization for ship electric power system is established, an objective function is optimized in multi-objective quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm, the real-time optimal scheduling for hybrid energy systems of the ship is realized. Experiments on actual navigation data verify the feasibility of the multi-objective configuration optimization method using the quantum artificial bee colony (QABC) algorithm. Furthermore, energy management experiments using different strategies, experimental results show that the energy management strategy proposed in this paper outperforms other methods, effectively reduces the operating costs, fuel costs, and pollutant emissions of marine power system, meet the environmental requirements of the Energy Efficiency Operating Index (EEOI) for ships.","2022","5/11/2022 15:23","5/12/2022 23:07",null,"124131",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\Y4Z27BYU\\Si et al. - 2022 - Configuration optimization and energy management o.pdf",null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.75,0.733333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Not assigned","Not assigned",null,"Manufacturing","Manufacture of electrical equipment","Manufacture of electric motors, generators, transformers and electricity distribution and control apparatus","Manufacture of electric motors, generators, transformers and electricity distribution and control apparatus"],["AG8T9SYN","journalArticle",2021,"Ren, F.; Feng, W.","Homotopy-SQP coupled method for optimal control of far-distance nonplanar rapid cooperative rendezvous with multiple specific-direction thrusts",12375.0,null,"Advances in Space Research",null,null,"10.1016/j.asr.2021.06.019","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108534059&doi=10.1016%2fj.asr.2021.06.019&partnerID=40&md5=d0f1f164de3e477f78bbf3106d628f2c","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","H","52","522","5229",null,"2021","5/11/2022 16:08","5/13/2022 22:17",null,"3176-3190",null,"8","68",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Scopus",null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\AMEIJWDS\\Ren and Feng - 2021 - Homotopy-SQP coupled method for optimal control of.pdf; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\F9QSFPRB\\S0273117721004890.html",null,"included","Optimal control; Cooperative rendezvous; Multiple specific-direction thrusts; Indirect method; Intelligent algorithm",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","NO","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.555555556,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q2",0.613,null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Other transportation support activities"],["KPLNY54V","journalArticle",2021,"Ren, Fei","Optimization for Far-distance Cooperative Rendezvous with Multiple Direction-fixed Thrusts",130053.0,null,"Journal of Physics: Conference Series",null,null,"10.1088/1742-6596/2068/1/012021","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142466149","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","H","52","522","5229","The continuous-thrust far-distance cooperative rendezvous problem between two spacecraft is investigated.

To overcome the difficulty in nonsmooth integration caused by the bang-bang control, the homotopy method is adopted to solve the fuel-optimal problem from a related energy-optimal problem. The quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is used to obtain the energy-optimal solutions. The energy-optimal solutions are used as the initial values for the homotopic procedure to obtain the fuel-optimal solutions and optimal bang-bang control law. A hybrid algorithm combined homotopy method and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm is proposed. This hybrid algorithm can effectively obtain feasible optimal solutions even though the indirect optimization method exhibits a narrow convergence domain.

Given an initially clustered formation, a configuration, based on satellite coverage requirements, is set as the final configuration which the cluster aims to achieve, with minimal fuel consumption. Results show that QPSO had a better performance compared to traditional PSO, yielding faster convergence, higher accuracy, as well as better reliability to evade local minima by exploring a wider search spread.","2021","5/11/2022 16:12","5/13/2022 21:52",null,"379-389",null,null,null,null,null,null,"Lecture Notes in Computer Science",null,null,null,"Springer International Publishing","Cham","en",null,null,null,null,"Springer Link",null,null,null,null,null,"included","Optimization; PSO; Lambert theorem; Quantum PSO; Satellite formation reconfiguration","Rutkowski, Leszek; Scherer, Rafa\u0142; Korytkowski, Marcin; Pedrycz, Witold; Tadeusiewicz, Ryszard; Zurada, Jacek M.",null,"YES","NO","NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.444444444,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"National: Poland","Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Other transportation support activities"],["77GKKSBZ","journalArticle",2020,"Wang, Z.; Dong, Y.; Feng, W.; Zhao, J.","Optimization for far-distance and fuel-limited cooperative rendezvous between two coplanar spacecraft based on Lambert method",29080.0,null,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part G: Journal of Aerospace Engineering",null,null,"10.1177/0954410019900447","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078786399&doi=10.1177%2f0954410019900447&partnerID=40&md5=2011645b471493affc083906f90c706e","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","H","52","522","5229",null,"2020","5/11/2022 16:08","5/15/2022 18:52",null,"1301-1310",null,"7","234",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Scopus",null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\VP83G3W6\\Wang et al. - 2020 - Optimization for far-distance and fuel-limited coo.pdf",null,"included","quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization; Cooperative rendezvous; far-distance orbit maneuver; Lambert's problem; sequential quadratic programming; trajectory optimization",null,null,"NO",null,"NO","YES",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.375,0.642857143,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q2",0.39,null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Other transportation support activities"],["WNGS4R5C","journalArticle",2020,"Yu, G.; Zhao, Y.; Cui, Z.; Zuo, Y.","A QPSO algorithm based on hierarchical weight and its application in cloud computing task scheduling",19300157037.0,null,"Computer Science and Information Systems",null,null,"10.2298/CSIS200223033Y","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100571358&doi=10.2298%2fCSIS200223033Y&partnerID=40&md5=8b8318ec52e94c55d7d587207c3deb69","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","J","63","631","6311",null,"2020","5/11/2022 15:03","5/15/2022 17:27",null,"189-212",null,"1","18",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Scopus",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","NO","NO","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.555555556,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q3",0.244,null,"Information and communication","Information service activities","Data processing, hosting and related activities; web portals","Data processing, hosting and related activities"],["HJULMHY8","conferencePaper",2021,"Pang, Tailai; Song, Yujuan; Zhu, Daqi","Task allocation for multi-AUV system under ocean current environment",null,null,"2021 China Automation Congress (CAC)",null,null,"10.1109/CAC53003.2021.9727785",null,"Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Conference","M","71","711","7110","The task allocation of multi-autonomous underwater vehicle systems (MAUVs) is how to allocate tasks to appropriate AUVs under certain constraints.

In this paper we propose to leverage their capabilities to address an important task for recommender systems providers, the optimal selection of recommendation carousels. In many video-on-demand and music streaming services the user is provided with a homepage containing several recommendation lists, i.e., carousels, each built with a certain criteria (e.g., artist, mood, Action movies etc.). Choosing which set of carousels to display is a difficult problem because it needs to account for how the different recommendation lists interact, e.g., avoiding duplicate recommendations, and how they help the user explore the catalogue. We focus in particular on the adiabatic computing paradigm and use the D-Wave quantum annealer, which is able to solve NP-hard optimization problems, can be programmed by classical operations research tools and is freely available on the cloud. We propose a formulation of the carousel selection problem for black box recommenders, that can be solved effectively on a quantum annealer and has the advantage of being simple.

Among others, an important goal is the minimization of the total transit time of the passengers. The corresponding objective function is quadratic in the binary decision variables encoding the flight-to-gate assignment. Hence, it is a quadratic assignment problem being hard to solve in general. In this work we investigate the solvability of this problem with a D-Wave quantum annealer. These machines are optimizers for quadratic unconstrained optimization problems (QUBO). Therefore the flight gate assignment problem seems to be well suited for these machines. We use real world data from a mid-sized German airport as well as simulation based data to extract typical instances small enough to be amenable to the D-Wave machine. In order to mitigate precision problems, we employ bin packing on the passenger numbers to reduce the precision requirements of the extracted instances. We find that, for the instances we investigated, the bin packing has little effect on the solution quality. Hence, we were able to solve small problem instances extracted from real data with the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer.","2019","4/25/2022 14:01","5/13/2022 22:04",null,"99-110",null,null,null,null,null,null,"Lecture Notes in Computer Science",null,null,null,"Springer International Publishing","Cham","en",null,null,null,null,"Springer Link",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\2MYGAWJY\\Stollenwerk et al. - 2019 - Flight Gate Assignment with a Quantum Annealer.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball","Quantum annealing; Airport planning; Quadratic assignment problem; QUBO","Feld, Sebastian; Linnhoff-Popien, Claudia",null,"NO",null,"YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES",null,"NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.571428571,0.642857143,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Service activities incidental to air transportation"],["VC9K5BV6","journalArticle",2020,"Stollenwerk, Tobias; O\u2019Gorman, Bryan; Venturelli, Davide; Mandr\u00e0, Salvatore; Rodionova, Olga; Ng, Hokkwan; Sridhar, Banavar; Rieffel, Eleanor Gilbert; Biswas, Rupak","Quantum Annealing Applied to De-Conflicting Optimal Trajectories for Air Traffic Management",18378.0,null,"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems",null,"1558-0016","10.1109/TITS.2019.2891235",null,"Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Journal","H","52","522","5223","We present the mapping of a class of simplified air traffic management problems (strategic conflict resolution) to quadratic unconstrained Boolean optimization problems.

The representation allows a natural decomposition of a real-world instance related to wind-optimal trajectories over the Atlantic Ocean into smaller subproblems that can be discretized and are amenable to be programmed in quantum annealers. In this paper, we tested the new programming techniques, and we benchmark the hardness of the instances using both classical solvers and the D-Wave 2X and D-Wave 2000Q quantum chip. The preliminary results show that for reasonable modeling choices, the most challenging subproblems which are programmable in the current devices are solved to optimality with 99% of probability within a second of annealing time.","2020-01","4/25/2022 14:01","5/13/2022 22:04",null,"285-297",null,"1","21",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\PHKJEJMB\\8643733.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\XIFDSBNL\\Stollenwerk et al. - 2020 - Quantum Annealing Applied to De-Conflicting Optima.pdf; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\H9EC435K\\Stollenwerk et al. - 2020 - Quantum Annealing Applied to De-Conflicting Optima.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball","Optimization; Annealing; Quantum computing; Fuels; Quantum Physics; Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms; Trajectory; Air traffic management; classical optimization; Delays; NASA; optimal trajectories; quantum optimization",null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.75,0.8,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",1.591,null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Service activities incidental to air transportation"],["VCWQ8SF7","conferencePaper",2021,"Singh, Amit; Lin, Chun-Yu; Huang, Chung-I; Lin, Fang-Pang","Quantum Annealing Approach for the Optimal Real-time Traffic Control using QUBO",null,1214.0,"2021 IEEE/ACIS 22nd International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD)",null,null,"10.1109/SNPD51163.2021.9704985",null,"Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization",null,null,"Conference","H","52","522","5229","Traffic congestion is one of the major issues in urban areas, particularly when traffic loads exceed the road\u2019s capacity, resulting in higher petrol consumption and carbon emissions as well as delays and stress for road users. In Asia, the traffic situation can be further deteriorated by road sharing of scooters. How to control the traffic flow to mitigate the congestion has been one of the central issues in transportation research. In this study, we employ a quantum annealing approach to optimize the traffic signals control at a real-life intersection with mixed traffic flows of vehicles and scooters. Considering traffic flow is a continuous and emerging phenomenon, we used quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formalism for traffic optimization, which has a natural equivalence to the Ising model and can be solved efficiently on the quantum annealers, quantum computers or digital annealers. In this article, we first applied the QUBO traffic optimization to artificially generated traffic for a simple intersection, and then we used real-time traffic data to simulate a real \"Dongda-Keyuan\" intersection with dedicated cars and scooter lanes, as well as mixed scooter and car lanes. We introduced two types of traffic light control systems for traffic optimization: C-QUBO and QUBO. Our rigorous QUBO optimizations show that C-QUBO and QUBO outperform the commonly used fixed cycle method, with QUBO outperforming C-QUBO in some instances. It has been found that QUBO optimization significantly relieves traffic congestion for the unbalanced traffic volume. Furthermore, we found that dynamic changes in traffic light signal duration greatly reduce traffic congestion.","2021-11","5/3/2022 15:49","5/13/2022 22:06",null,"74-81",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"ISSN: 2693-8421",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\S84X95F3\\9704985.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\L2YQSACW\\9704985.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\3ZULA6CL\\Singh et al. - 2021 - Quantum Annealing Approach for the Optimal Real-ti.pdf",null,"included","Annealing; Quantum annealing; Urban areas; Motorcycles; Real-time systems; quantum computing; quantum annealing; Correlation; QUBO; real-time optimization; Roads; traffic optimization; traffic signal control",null,"2021 IEEE/ACIS 22nd International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD)","YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.75,0.8,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"C","Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Other transportation support activities"],["GPT28I5I","conferencePaper",2019,"James, Scott Howard; Raheb, Robert Nicholas","Path Planning for Critical ATM/UTM Areas",null,null,"2019 IEEE/AIAA 38th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)",null,null,"10.1109/DASC43569.2019.9081662",null,"Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization",null,null,"Conference","H","52","522","5223","We create a path planning algorithm to be used in areas where conventional aircraft and Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAV) are in close proximity.

NSP seeks the optimal assignment for a set of nurses to shifts under an accompanying set of constraints on schedule and personnel. After reducing NSP to a novel Ising-type Hamiltonian, we evaluate the solution quality obtained from the D-Wave 2000Q against the constraint requirements as well as the diversity of solutions. For the test problems explored here, our results indicate that quantum annealing recovers satisfying solutions for NSP and suggests the heuristic method is potentially achievable for practical use. Moreover, we observe that solution quality can be greatly improved through the use of reverse annealing, in which it is possible to refine returned results by using the annealing process a second time.

It arises in practical applications where a set of physical locations need to be equipped with services to satisfy demand within a certain area, while minimizing costs. In this paper we formulate the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, apply the hybrid framework of the D-Wave quantum annealer to solve it, and investigate the feasibility of this approach. To improve the often suboptimal initial solutions found on the D-Wave system, we develop a hybrid quantum/classical optimization algorithm that starts from the seed solution and iteratively creates small subproblems that are more efficiently solved on the D-Wave but often still converge to feasible and improved solutions of the original problem. Finally we suggest some opportunities for increasing the accuracy and performance of our algorithm.","2020","5/11/2022 15:39","5/16/2022 14:41",null,"531-545",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-50433-5_41",null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.666666667,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"A","Public administration and defence;

In this model, the wavelet packet decomposition method is used to reasonably decompose the high-frequency fluctuation and low-frequency fluctuation of renewable energy to achieve the function of stabilizing fluctuation. Meanwhile, an operation strategy for hybrid energy storage to participate in demand response is proposed. Rain flow counting method is used to research the life of hybrid energy storage system, which improves the accuracy of energy storage annual cost calculation. In the Simulation and Analysis section, the genetic quantum algorithm is used for simulation and analysis of the role and benefits of hybrid energy storage.

Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA), which originates from the organic integration of quantum computing and genetic algorithms, has the advantages of outstanding ability to seek optimal solutions, faster computing speed and smaller overall computing scale, and can solve multi-objective scheduling or optimization problems well.

A hybrid QIEA is presented for multiple knapsack problem which incorporates several features for better balance between exploration and exploitation. The proposed QIEA, dubbed QIEA-MKP, provides significantly improved performance over simple QIEA from both the perspectives viz., the quality of solutions and computational effort required to reach the best solution.

Most often software product developments are iterative and incremental in their nature, due to the changes in the customer requirements from time to time. It is a challenging task to select the requirements from a large number of candidates, for the accomplishment of the business goals. The problem is to identify a set of requirements to be included in the next release of the product, by minimizing the cost and maximizing the customer satisfaction. Since minimizing the total cost and maximizing the customer satisfaction are contradictory objectives, the problem has a multi-objective nature. This problem is NP-hard in its nature and so it cannot be solved efficiently by using traditional optimization techniques for large problem instances. QEMEA combines the best features of Evolutionary Algorithms and Quantum Computing. It employs the concepts of Quantum computing such as superposition and interference.

Rational gate allocation is regarded as one of the most important means to solve this bottleneck. In this paper, in order to comprehensively considere different stakeholders, a three-objective gate allocation model is to consider a wider scope, in which the minimizing passenger walking distances, the most balanced idle time of each gate and the best full use of large gate are optimized simultaneously to improve the practical efficiency. To efficiently solve this model, an improved quantum evolutionary algorithm (QEA) based on the niche co-evolution strategy and enhanced particle swarm optimization (PSO), namely IPOQEA is designed. An IPOQEA-based gate allocation method is proposed to allocate the flights to suitable gates within different periods. Finally, the actual operation data of Baiyun Airport is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Comparison results show that the constructed model can address the passenger walking distances, robustness and costs in airport management. Moreover, the IPOQEA has better optimization ability in solving gate allocation problem. Therefore, the proposed gate allocation method has great potential for practical engineering since it can easily make decisions for airport managers.","2022-03","5/4/2022 10:25","5/13/2022 21:03",null,"1737-1745",null,"3","23",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\SD597D35\\9210735.html;

The analyses suggest that the good solutions are clustered in the search space and there is a correlation between the \ufb01tness of a local optimum and its distance to the best solution. Inspired by these \ufb01ndings, a new operator for Quantum Evolutionary Algorithms is proposed which, during the search process, collects information about the \ufb01tness landscape and tried to capture the backbone structure of the landscape. The knowledge it has collected is used to guide the search process towards a better region in the search space. The proposed algorithm consists of two phases. The \ufb01rst phase uses a tabu mechanism to collect information about the \ufb01tness landscape. In the second phase, the collected data are processed to guide the algorithm towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm clusters the good solutions it has found in its previous search process. Then when the population is converged and trapped in a local optimum, it is divided into sub-populations and each sub-population is designated to a cluster. The information in the database is then used to reinitialize the q-individuals, so they represent better regions in the search space. This way the population maintains diversity and by capturing the \ufb01tness landscape structure, the algorithm is guided towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm is compared with some state-ofthe-art algorithms from PATAT competition conferences and experimental results are presented.","2021-04","5/4/2022 14:30","5/13/2022 22:40","5/4/2022 14:30","114211",null,null,"168",null,"Expert Systems with Applications","How to exploit fitness landscape properties of timetabling problem",null,null,null,null,null,null,"en",null,null,null,null,"DOI.org (Crossref)",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\AKDUX97Q\\Najaran - 2021 - How to exploit fitness landscape properties of tim.pdf",null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.875,0.6,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",2.07,null,"Professional, scientific and technical activities","Activities of head offices; management consultancy activities","Activities of head offices","Activities of head offices"]],"hovertemplate":"<b>S<sub>R</sub>: %{x}</b><br>S<sub>S</sub>: %{customdata[81]}<br>DOI: %{customdata[10]}","marker":{"outliercolor":"black"},"meanline":{"color":"black","visible":true},"name":"Quantum-inspired Evolutionary Algorithm","points":"all","x":[0.733333333,0.666666667,0.714285714,0.8,0.6,0.733333333,0.733333333,0.733333333,0.666666667,0.6],"type":"violin"}],                        {"template":{"data":{"pie":[{"automargin":true,"type":"pie"}]},"layout":{"xaxis":{"showgrid":true,"title":{"standoff":15}},"yaxis":{"showgrid":true,"title":{"standoff":15}}}},"xaxis":{"range":[0,1],"title":{"text":"$S_R$"}},"yaxis":{"title":{"text":"Algorithm Name"}},"margin":{"l":300},"showlegend":false},                        {"responsive": true}                    )                };                            </script>        </div></div>

In this paper we propose to leverage their capabilities to address an important task for recommender systems providers, the optimal selection of recommendation carousels. In many video-on-demand and music streaming services the user is provided with a homepage containing several recommendation lists, i.e., carousels, each built with a certain criteria (e.g., artist, mood, Action movies etc.). Choosing which set of carousels to display is a difficult problem because it needs to account for how the different recommendation lists interact, e.g., avoiding duplicate recommendations, and how they help the user explore the catalogue. We focus in particular on the adiabatic computing paradigm and use the D-Wave quantum annealer, which is able to solve NP-hard optimization problems, can be programmed by classical operations research tools and is freely available on the cloud.

In this work we investigate the solvability of this problem with a D-Wave quantum annealer. These machines are optimizers for quadratic unconstrained optimization problems (QUBO). Therefore the flight gate assignment problem seems to be well suited for these machines. We use real world data from a mid-sized German airport as well as simulation based data to extract typical instances small enough to be amenable to the D-Wave machine. In order to mitigate precision problems, we employ bin packing on the passenger numbers to reduce the precision requirements of the extracted instances. We find that, for the instances we investigated, the bin packing has little effect on the solution quality. Hence, we were able to solve small problem instances extracted from real data with the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer.","2019","4/25/2022 14:01","5/13/2022 22:04",null,"99-110",null,null,null,null,null,null,"Lecture Notes in Computer Science",null,null,null,"Springer International Publishing","Cham","en",null,null,null,null,"Springer Link",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\2MYGAWJY\\Stollenwerk et al. - 2019 - Flight Gate Assignment with a Quantum Annealer.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball","Quantum annealing; Airport planning; Quadratic assignment problem; QUBO","Feld, Sebastian; Linnhoff-Popien, Claudia",null,"NO",null,"YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES",null,"NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.571428571,0.642857143,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Service activities incidental to air transportation"],["VC9K5BV6","journalArticle",2020,"Stollenwerk, Tobias; O\u2019Gorman, Bryan; Venturelli, Davide; Mandr\u00e0, Salvatore; Rodionova, Olga; Ng, Hokkwan; Sridhar, Banavar; Rieffel, Eleanor Gilbert; Biswas, Rupak","Quantum Annealing Applied to De-Conflicting Optimal Trajectories for Air Traffic Management",18378.0,null,"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems",null,"1558-0016","10.1109/TITS.2019.2891235",null,"Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Journal","H","52","522","5223","We present the mapping of a class of simplified air traffic management problems (strategic conflict resolution) to quadratic unconstrained Boolean optimization problems.

The representation allows a natural decomposition of a real-world instance related to wind-optimal trajectories over the Atlantic Ocean into smaller subproblems that can be discretized and are amenable to be programmed in quantum annealers. In this paper, we tested the new programming techniques, and we benchmark the hardness of the instances using both classical solvers and the D-Wave 2X and D-Wave 2000Q quantum chip.

NSP seeks the optimal assignment for a set of nurses to shifts under an accompanying set of constraints on schedule and personnel. After reducing NSP to a novel Ising-type Hamiltonian, we evaluate the solution quality obtained from the D-Wave 2000Q against the constraint requirements as well as the diversity of solutions. For the test problems explored here, our results indicate that quantum annealing recovers satisfying solutions for NSP and suggests the heuristic method is potentially achievable for practical use. Moreover, we observe that solution quality can be greatly improved through the use of reverse annealing, in which it is possible to refine returned results by using the annealing process a second time. We compare the performance of NSP using both forward and reverse annealing methods and describe how this approach might be used in practice.","2019","5/4/2022 10:49","5/16/2022 16:18",null,"12837",null,"1","9",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.555555556,0.733333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",1.341,null,"Human health and social work activities","Human health activities","Hospital activities","Hospital activities"],["MXVUMVPM","conferencePaper",2021,"Henderson, Jessie M.; O\u2019Malley, Daniel; Viswanathan, Hari S.","Interrogating the performance of quantum annealing for the solution of steady-state subsurface flow",null,null,"2021 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)",null,null,"10.1109/HPEC49654.2021.9622819",null,"Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Conference","E","36","360","3600","In the 1990s, the principles of quantum mechanics were leveraged to describe how discrete combinatorial optimization problems could be solved using a method called quantum annealing.

To improve the often suboptimal initial solutions found on the D-Wave system, we develop a hybrid quantum/classical optimization algorithm that starts from the seed solution and iteratively creates small subproblems that are more efficiently solved on the D-Wave but often still converge to feasible and improved solutions of the original problem.

It was only recently that small but functional quantum computers have become available on the cloud, allowing to test their potential. In this paper we propose to leverage their capabilities to address an important task for recommender systems providers, the optimal selection of recommendation carousels. In many video-on-demand and music streaming services the user is provided with a homepage containing several recommendation lists, i.e., carousels, each built with a certain criteria (e.g., artist, mood, Action movies etc.). Choosing which set of carousels to display is a difficult problem because it needs to account for how the different recommendation lists interact, e.g., avoiding duplicate recommendations, and how they help the user explore the catalogue. We focus in particular on the adiabatic computing paradigm and use the D-Wave quantum annealer, which is able to solve NP-hard optimization problems, can be programmed by classical operations research tools and is freely available on the cloud. We propose a formulation of the carousel selection problem for black box recommenders, that can be solved effectively on a quantum annealer and has the advantage of being simple. We discuss its effectiveness, limitations and possible future directions of development.  2021 Owner/Author.","2021","4/11/2022 15:14","5/13/2022 22:04",null,"691-696",null,null,null,null,null,null,"RecSys 2021 - 15th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems",null,null,null,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","Virtual, Online, Netherlands",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\B9BIPMP8\\Ferrari Dacrema et al. - 2021 - Optimizing the selection of recommendation carouse.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3460231.3478853","Optimization; Annealing; Quantum computers; Recommender systems; Operations research; User interfaces; Video on demand; included; reverse snowball; forward snowball",null,null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","NO",null,"NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",0.714285714,0.866666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"A","Information and communication","Information service activities","Data processing, hosting and related activities; web portals","Data processing, hosting and related activities"],["KKR576SB","journalArticle",2017,"Neukart, Florian; Compostella, Gabriele; Seidel, Christian; von Dollen, David; Yarkoni, Sheir; Parney, Bob","Traffic Flow Optimization Using a Quantum Annealer",21100893766.0,null,"Frontiers in ICT",null,"2297-198X","10.3389/fict.2017.00029","https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fict.2017.00029","Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Journal","H","52","522","5229","Quantum annealing algorithms belong to the class of metaheuristic tools, applicable for solving binary optimization problems. Hardware implementations of quantum annealing, such as the quantum processing units (QPUs) produced by D-Wave Systems, have been subject to multiple analyses in research, with the aim of characterizing the technology\u2019s usefulness for optimization and sampling tasks. In this paper, we present a real-world application that uses quantum technologies. Specifically, we show how to map certain parts of a real-world traffic flow optimization problem to be suitable for quantum annealing. We show that time-critical optimization tasks, such as continuous redistribution of position data for cars in dense road networks, are suitable candidates for quantum computing. Due to the limited size and connectivity of current-generation D-Wave QPUs, we use a hybrid quantum and classical approach to solve the traffic flow problem.","2017","4/24/2022 18:26","5/13/2022 22:04","4/24/2022 18:26",null,null,null,"4",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Frontiers",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\CTK8HSJK\\Neukart et al. - 2017 - Traffic Flow Optimization Using a Quantum Annealer.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball",null,null,null,"YES","NO","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.625,0.733333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Not assigned","Not assigned",null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Other transportation support activities"],["N4AXE29P","journalArticle",2019,"Ohzeki, Masayuki; Miki, Akira; Miyama, Masamichi J.; Terabe, Masayoshi","Control of Automated Guided Vehicles Without Collision by Quantum Annealer and Digital Devices",null,null,"Frontiers in Computer Science",null,"2624-9898","10.3389/fcomp.2019.00009","https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fcomp.2019.00009","Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Journal","H","52","522","5229","Recent advance on quantum devices realizes an artificial quantum spin system known as the D-Wave 2000Q, which implements the Ising model with tunable transverse field.

However the resulting spin configurations are not always in the ground state. It can rather quickly generate many spin configurations following the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution. In the present study, we formulate an Ising model to control a large number of automated guided vehicles in a factory without collision.

In this work we investigate the solvability of this problem with a D-Wave quantum annealer. These machines are optimizers for quadratic unconstrained optimization problems (QUBO). Therefore the flight gate assignment problem seems to be well suited for these machines. We use real world data from a mid-sized German airport as well as simulation based data to extract typical instances small enough to be amenable to the D-Wave machine. In order to mitigate precision problems, we employ bin packing on the passenger numbers to reduce the precision requirements of the extracted instances. We find that, for the instances we investigated, the bin packing has little effect on the solution quality.

NSP seeks the optimal assignment for a set of nurses to shifts under an accompanying set of constraints on schedule and personnel. After reducing NSP to a novel Ising-type Hamiltonian, we evaluate the solution quality obtained from the D-Wave 2000Q against the constraint requirements as well as the diversity of solutions. For the test problems explored here, our results indicate that quantum annealing recovers satisfying solutions for NSP and suggests the heuristic method is potentially achievable for practical use. Moreover, we observe that solution quality can be greatly improved through the use of reverse annealing, in which it is possible to refine returned results by using the annealing process a second time.

This paper proposes a hybrid QC-based deep learning framework for fault diagnosis of electrical power systems that combine the feature extraction capabilities of conditional restricted Boltzmann machine with an efficient classification of deep networks. Computational challenges stemming from the complexities of such deep learning models are overcome by QC-based training methodologies that effectively leverage the complementary strengths of quantum assisted learning and classical training techniques. The proposed hybrid QC-based deep learning framework is tested on a simulated electrical power system with 30 buses and wide variations of substation and transmission line faults, to demonstrate the framework\u2019s applicability, efficiency, and generalization capabilities. High computational efficiency is enjoyed by the proposed hybrid approach in terms of computational effort required and quality of diagnosis performance over classical training methods. In addition, superior and reliable fault diagnosis performance with faster response time is achieved over state-of-the-art pattern recognition methods based on artificial neural networks (ANN) and decision trees (DT).","2021","5/11/2022 15:39","5/15/2022 17:13",null,"117628",null,null,"303",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\D8K5CDWH\\Ajagekar and You - 2021 - Quantum computing based hybrid deep learning for f.pdf",null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","NO","NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.555555556,0.8,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",3.062,null,"Manufacturing","Repair and installation of machinery and equipment","Repair of fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment","Repair of electrical equipment"],["I4392TBW","conferencePaper",2021,"Kuroda, T.; Kuwahara, T.; Yonaga, K.; Osaki, T.; Miyama, M.J.; Ohzeki, M.","Quantum annealing for ICT system design automation",null,695.0,null,null,null,"10.1109/CCGrid51090.2021.00025","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114897752&doi=10.1109%2fCCGrid51090.2021.00025&partnerID=40&md5=592ca6b65adab19df6e16a83ed8ee323","Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Conference","J","62","620","6202",null,"2021","5/11/2022 16:35","5/15/2022 15:32",null,"156-165",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Scopus",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"included",null,null,"Proceedings - 21st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing, CCGrid 2021","YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.555555556,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"A","Information and communication","Computer programming, consultancy and related activities","Computer programming, consultancy and related activities","Computer consultancy and computer facilities management activities"],["GHUSTHSC","bookSection",2020,"Chiscop, Irina; Nauta, Jelle; Veerman, Bert; Phillipson, Frank","A Hybrid Solution Method for the Multi-Service Location Set Covering Problem",null,952.0,"Computational Science \u2013 ICCS 2020",null,null,"10.1007/978-3-030-50433-5_41","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128623258","Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Conference","O","84","841","8413","Abstract The Multi-Service Location Set Covering Problem is an extension of the well-known Set Covering Problem. It arises in practical applications where a set of physical locations need to be equipped with services to satisfy demand within a certain area, while minimizing costs. In this paper we formulate the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, apply the hybrid framework of the D-Wave quantum annealer to solve it, and investigate the feasibility of this approach. To improve the often suboptimal initial solutions found on the D-Wave system, we develop a hybrid quantum/classical optimization algorithm that starts from the seed solution and iteratively creates small subproblems that are more efficiently solved on the D-Wave but often still converge to feasible and improved solutions of the original problem. Finally we suggest some opportunities for increasing the accuracy and performance of our algorithm.","2020","5/11/2022 15:39","5/16/2022 14:41",null,"531-545",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-50433-5_41",null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.666666667,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"A","Public administration and defence;

In reality, demand of a certain product becomes highly effected by on-hand stock level in stores and the selling price of the product. In the proposed model, demand of the product is dependent on these two vital deceive factors. In real life production systems, always there are some defective products which requires reworking in order to make them useful. The possibility of producing some defective items in regular production process and their reworking has been taken into account in the model. In case of inventories of highly demandable products, it is observed that production rate is proportional to demand. The situation also arises in case of launching a new product or in a multi-stage production system. In this model, production rate is a variable and it varies with the demand rate. Shortages are allowed and it is backlogged fully. Based on these assumptions, several researchers worked on but they considered that the associated inventory cost parameters are fixed real numbers. However, these are not fixed in reality and may vary time to time depending upon some scenario. Main objective of the paper is to develop a production inventory model under those assumptions considering various cost parameters as interval numbers. As a result the corresponding optimization problem is also interval valued. Quantum behaved particle swarm optimization technique has been applied to find the maximum profit in a single cycle. Numerical example and sensitivity analysis are given to illustrate the proposed inventory model.  2019, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.","2020","4/11/2022 15:14","5/4/2022 11:23",null,"385-399",null,"2","11",null,"International Journal of Systems Assurance Engineering and Management",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Publisher: Springer",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\TY5WT3EX\\Ruidas et al. - 2020 - An EPQ model with stock and selling price dependen.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13198-019-00867-w","Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Numerical methods; Sensitivity analysis; Inventory control; Defects; included; reverse snowball; forward snowball",null,null,null,"NO",null,"NO","YES",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.25,0.857142857,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q3",0.3,null,"Manufacturing","Manufacture of leather and related products","Tanning and dressing of leather; manufacture of luggage, handbags, saddlery and harness; dressing and dyeing of fur","Manufacture of luggage, handbags and the like, saddlery and harness"],["S7PQWZ65","conferencePaper",2018,"Zhang, Y.; Lyden, S.; De La Barra, B.A.L.; Haque, M.E.","Optimization of Tremblay's battery model parameters for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle applications",null,null,null,null,null,"10.1109/AUPEC.2017.8282405","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050917674&doi=10.1109%2fAUPEC.2017.8282405&partnerID=40&md5=b21f7e69bb78699deeb9f376bdd9e4f5","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Conference","C","27","272","2720",null,"2018","4/11/2022 15:15","5/11/2022 16:18",null,"1-6",null,null,"2017-November",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Scopus",null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\AGZQ94JW\\Zhang et al. - 2018 - Optimization of Tremblay's battery model parameter.pdf",null,"included; reverse snowball; forward snowball",null,null,"2017 Australasian Universities Power Engineering Conference, AUPEC 2017","YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.75,0.6,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"Not assigned","Manufacturing","Manufacture of electrical equipment","Manufacture of batteries and accumulators","Manufacture of batteries and accumulators"],["ITNK88F2","conferencePaper",2020,"Sheng, Jiangfan; Kong, Weijian; Qi, Jie","Process optimization of carbon fiber precursor spinning coagulation process based on surrogate model",null,null,"2020 Chinese Automation Congress (CAC)",null,null,"10.1109/CAC51589.2020.9326779",null,"Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Conference","C","23","239","2399","High-quality carbon fiber precursor is the key to the manufacture of high-performance carbon fiber, and the coagulation process is one of the key steps in the preparation of the precursor. This coagulation process is an industrial process with complex mechanism and strict control accuracy requirements. Therefore, iterative optimization based on its strict mechanism model will be much time-consuming. In order to reduce the computational cost, a process optimization method for the coagulation process of carbon liber precursor spinning based on surrogate model was proposed. Using meta-modeling technology, this paper constructs the surrogate model which describes the relationship between the key operating parameters and the main output variables in the coagulation process. In the process of constructing the surrogate model, an evolutionary optimal sample point insertion criterion is adopted to improve the accuracy of the model. And the quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is applied for searching operating parameters in the design space.

During the optimization process, QPSO and IQPSO algorithms minimize the structural weight subject to performance constraints on inter-story drift ratios based on FEMA-356 provisions at the immediate occupancy (IO), life safety (LS) and collapse prevention (CP) performance levels. Nonlinear pushover analysis is conducted to compute the necessary structural responses during the PBOD process. Two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the efficiency of the presented methodology. The numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed IQPSO to the classical QPSO algorithm.","2014-02-01","4/27/2022 13:01","5/5/2022 18:34","4/27/2022 13:01","143-156",null,"2","17",null,"Advances in Structural Engineering",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"SAGE Journals",null,"Publisher: SAGE Publications Ltd STM",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\XTL5YC8J\\Gholizadeh and Moghadas - 2014 - Performance-Based Optimum Design of Steel Frames b.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball",null,null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.625,0.8,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q2",0.544,null,"Manufacturing","Manufacture of basic metals","Casting of metals","Casting of iron and steel"],["XCRU4NTE","journalArticle",2014,"Chen, Wen-Jong; Su, Wen-Cheng; Yang, Yin-Liang","Application of Constrained Multi-Objective Hybrid Quantum Particle Swarm optimization for Improving Performance of an Ironless Permanent Magnet Linear Motor",21100197928.0,null,"Applied Mathematics and Information Sciences",null,null,"10.12785/amis/080652","http://dx.doi.org/10.12785/amis/080652","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","C","27","271","2710","This study presents an ironless permanent magnet linear brushless motor (PMLBM) with three objective functions: maximal thrust force, minimal temperature, and minimal volume.

To validate the feasibility of the proposed approach, several numerical approximation experiments were firstly designed, after which real vibrational data of bearings from the Laboratory of Cincinnati University were analyzed and used to assess the health condition for a given future point.

Here, CEED is represented using cubic criterion function to reduce the nonlinearities of the system. Along with economic load dispatch, emissions of SO2, NOx, and CO2 are considered as separate three objectives, thus making it a four-objective (many-objective) optimization problem. A unit-wise price penalty factor is considered here to convert all the objectives into a single objective in order to compare the final results with other previously used methods like Lagrangian relaxation (LR), particle swarm optimization, and simulated annealing. QBA is applied in six-unit power generation system for four different loads. The obtained results show QBA successfully solve many-objective CEED problem with greater superiority than other methods found in the literature in terms of quality results, robustness, and computational performance. In the end of this paper, a detailed future research direction is provided based on the simulation results and its analysis. The outcome of this research demonstrates that the inclusion of quantum computing idea in metaheuristic technique provides a useful and reliable tool for solving such many-objective optimization problem.","2019-10","4/11/2022 15:14","5/11/2022 16:34",null,"5857-69",null,"10","31",null,"Neural Computing and Applications",null,"Neural Comput.

The bat algorithm (BA) is an acknowledged metaheuristic optimization algorithm owing to its performance. However, the classical BA presents some weaknesses, such as premature convergence. To withstand the drawbacks of the BA, quantum mechanics theories and Gaussian and Cauchy operators are integrated into the standard BA to enhance its effectiveness. Since the economic load dispatch is a nonlinear, complex and constrained optimization problem, its main objective is to reduce the total generation cost while matching the equality and inequality constraints of the system. The validity of the CGQBA is tested on six standard benchmark functions with different characteristics. The numerical results indicate that the CGQBA is effective and superior to many other algorithms. Moreover, the CGQBA is applied to solve the ELD problems on various test systems including 3,6,20, 40,110 and 160 implemented generating units. The simulation results illustrate the strength of the CGQBA compared with other algorithms recently reported in the literature.","2021","5/11/2022 14:23","5/13/2022 22:09",null,"3207-3228",null,null,"9",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.777777778,0.733333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",0.927,null,"Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution"],["VHV33V7W","journalArticle",2019,"Zhang, Z.;

A novel hybrid multi-step-ahead forecast model is introduced to solve this problem. Partial autocorrelation function (PACF) is first used to analyze the characteristics of the target time series for extracting the appropriate input variables. Least-square support vector machine (LSSVM) with recursive mechanism is then explored for modelling multi-step-ahead forecasts, in which the forecast model is adjusted adaptively as long as new information is updated. The parameters in LSSVM are optimized based on an improved quantum-inspired version of Grey Wolf Optimizer (QGWO). The QGWO fortifies against the stagnation of the wolves at an optimal local point using three strategies including the quantum operator, non-linear convergence factor, and dynamic weighting. In this paper, the performance of QGWO was first demonstrated with that of other meta-heuristic (MH) algorithms in solving eight mathematical benchmark problems. Two time series of reservoir water availability in Zhoushan Islands, China, were then provided and analyzed to validate the performance of the advanced forecast approach in multi-step-ahead forecasts. The forecasts were compared with those obtained by the non-adaptive (NA) and non-recursive (NR) models. Results indicate that (1) QGWO displays superior performance on model parameters optimization than other comparative MH algorithms; (2) The proposed hybrid model in consideration of the nearest anterior feedback, as well as the adaptive mechanism, not only outperforms the two comparative models (NA, NR) but significantly enhances the accuracy of multi-step-ahead forecasts for non-stationary time series and low or high volume events, even as the forecast time horizon increases.","2021","5/3/2022 16:13","5/15/2022 16:40",null,"125769",null,null,"597",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\IUR5G3PH\\Guo et al. - 2021 - Multi-step-ahead forecast of reservoir water avail.pdf",null,"included","Adaptive and recursive mechanism; Island areas; Multi-step-ahead forecast; Quantum Grey Wolf Optimizer (QGWO); Reservoir water availability",null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.75,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",1.611,null,"Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities","Water collection, treatment and supply","Water collection, treatment and supply","Water collection, treatment and supply"],["B8A3QEUS","journalArticle",2020,"Feng, Z.-K.; Niu, W.-J.; Tang, Z.-Y.; Jiang, Z.-Q.; Xu, Y.; Liu, Y.; Zhang, H.-R.","Monthly runoff time series prediction by variational mode decomposition and support vector machine based on quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization",50089.0,null,"Journal of Hydrology",null,null,"10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124627","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078757694&doi=10.1016%2fj.jhydrol.2020.124627&partnerID=40&md5=c338003c62335fe67f04f7eb489751b1","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","E","36","360","3600",null,"2020","5/4/2022 11:38","5/16/2022 14:36",null,null,null,null,"583",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Scopus",null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\VYQP9NBE\\Feng et al. - 2020 - Monthly runoff time series prediction by variation.pdf",null,"included","Decomposition and ensemble; Machine learning technique; Monthly runoff prediction; Swarm intelligence method; Three Gorges and Danjiangkou Reservoirs",null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.75,0.733333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",1.684,null,"Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities","Water collection, treatment and supply","Water collection, treatment and supply","Water collection, treatment and supply"],["MXVUMVPM","conferencePaper",2021,"Henderson, Jessie M.; O\u2019Malley, Daniel; Viswanathan, Hari S.","Interrogating the performance of quantum annealing for the solution of steady-state subsurface flow",null,null,"2021 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)",null,null,"10.1109/HPEC49654.2021.9622819",null,"Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Conference","E","36","360","3600","In the 1990s, the principles of quantum mechanics were leveraged to describe how discrete combinatorial optimization problems could be solved using a method called quantum annealing.

In particular, we interrogate whether contemporary quantum annealers with more qubits, lower noise, and reverse annealing features can improve performance.

In this work we investigate the solvability of this problem with a D-Wave quantum annealer. These machines are optimizers for quadratic unconstrained optimization problems (QUBO). Therefore the flight gate assignment problem seems to be well suited for these machines. We use real world data from a mid-sized German airport as well as simulation based data to extract typical instances small enough to be amenable to the D-Wave machine. In order to mitigate precision problems, we employ bin packing on the passenger numbers to reduce the precision requirements of the extracted instances.

In Asia, the traffic situation can be further deteriorated by road sharing of scooters. How to control the traffic flow to mitigate the congestion has been one of the central issues in transportation research. In this study, we employ a quantum annealing approach to optimize the traffic signals control at a real-life intersection with mixed traffic flows of vehicles and scooters. Considering traffic flow is a continuous and emerging phenomenon, we used quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formalism for traffic optimization, which has a natural equivalence to the Ising model and can be solved efficiently on the quantum annealers, quantum computers or digital annealers. In this article, we first applied the QUBO traffic optimization to artificially generated traffic for a simple intersection, and then we used real-time traffic data to simulate a real \"Dongda-Keyuan\" intersection with dedicated cars and scooter lanes, as well as mixed scooter and car lanes. We introduced two types of traffic light control systems for traffic optimization: C-QUBO and QUBO. Our rigorous QUBO optimizations show that C-QUBO and QUBO outperform the commonly used fixed cycle method, with QUBO outperforming C-QUBO in some instances. It has been found that QUBO optimization significantly relieves traffic congestion for the unbalanced traffic volume. Furthermore, we found that dynamic changes in traffic light signal duration greatly reduce traffic congestion.","2021-11","5/3/2022 15:49","5/13/2022 22:06",null,"74-81",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"ISSN: 2693-8421",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\S84X95F3\\9704985.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\L2YQSACW\\9704985.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\3ZULA6CL\\Singh et al. - 2021 - Quantum Annealing Approach for the Optimal Real-ti.pdf",null,"included","Annealing; Quantum annealing; Urban areas; Motorcycles; Real-time systems; quantum computing; quantum annealing; Correlation; QUBO; real-time optimization; Roads; traffic optimization; traffic signal control",null,"2021 IEEE/ACIS 22nd International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD)","YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.75,0.8,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"C","Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Other transportation support activities"],["GPT28I5I","conferencePaper",2019,"James, Scott Howard; Raheb, Robert Nicholas","Path Planning for Critical ATM/UTM Areas",null,null,"2019 IEEE/AIAA 38th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)",null,null,"10.1109/DASC43569.2019.9081662",null,"Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization",null,null,"Conference","H","52","522","5223","We create a path planning algorithm to be used in areas where conventional aircraft and Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAV) are in close proximity.

Rational gate allocation is regarded as one of the most important means to solve this bottleneck. In this paper, in order to comprehensively considere different stakeholders, a three-objective gate allocation model is to consider a wider scope, in which the minimizing passenger walking distances, the most balanced idle time of each gate and the best full use of large gate are optimized simultaneously to improve the practical efficiency. To efficiently solve this model, an improved quantum evolutionary algorithm (QEA) based on the niche co-evolution strategy and enhanced particle swarm optimization (PSO), namely IPOQEA is designed. An IPOQEA-based gate allocation method is proposed to allocate the flights to suitable gates within different periods. Finally, the actual operation data of Baiyun Airport is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Comparison results show that the constructed model can address the passenger walking distances, robustness and costs in airport management. Moreover, the IPOQEA has better optimization ability in solving gate allocation problem. Therefore, the proposed gate allocation method has great potential for practical engineering since it can easily make decisions for airport managers.","2022-03","5/4/2022 10:25","5/13/2022 21:03",null,"1737-1745",null,"3","23",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\SD597D35\\9210735.html;

The indirect optimization method, based on Pontryagin\u2019s maximum principle (PMP), is applied to optimize fuel consumption. To overcome the difficulty in nonsmooth integration caused by the bang-bang control, the homotopy method is adopted to solve the fuel-optimal problem from a related energy-optimal problem. The quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is used to obtain the energy-optimal solutions. The energy-optimal solutions are used as the initial values for the homotopic procedure to obtain the fuel-optimal solutions and optimal bang-bang control law. A hybrid algorithm combined homotopy method and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm is proposed.

It was only recently that small but functional quantum computers have become available on the cloud, allowing to test their potential. In this paper we propose to leverage their capabilities to address an important task for recommender systems providers, the optimal selection of recommendation carousels. In many video-on-demand and music streaming services the user is provided with a homepage containing several recommendation lists, i.e., carousels, each built with a certain criteria (e.g., artist, mood, Action movies etc.). Choosing which set of carousels to display is a difficult problem because it needs to account for how the different recommendation lists interact, e.g., avoiding duplicate recommendations, and how they help the user explore the catalogue. We focus in particular on the adiabatic computing paradigm and use the D-Wave quantum annealer, which is able to solve NP-hard optimization problems, can be programmed by classical operations research tools and is freely available on the cloud. We propose a formulation of the carousel selection problem for black box recommenders, that can be solved effectively on a quantum annealer and has the advantage of being simple.

Most often software product developments are iterative and incremental in their nature, due to the changes in the customer requirements from time to time. It is a challenging task to select the requirements from a large number of candidates, for the accomplishment of the business goals. The problem is to identify a set of requirements to be included in the next release of the product, by minimizing the cost and maximizing the customer satisfaction. Since minimizing the total cost and maximizing the customer satisfaction are contradictory objectives, the problem has a multi-objective nature. This problem is NP-hard in its nature and so it cannot be solved efficiently by using traditional optimization techniques for large problem instances. QEMEA combines the best features of Evolutionary Algorithms and Quantum Computing. It employs the concepts of Quantum computing such as superposition and interference. The features of QEMEA help in achieving quality pareto-optimal front solutions and faster convergence while using a small population size. The performance of QEMEA is tested on six benchmark problems derived from the literature. The obtained results indicates consistent and superior performance of the algorithm.","2012-03","4/24/2022 22:18","5/4/2022 12:40",null,"782-787",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\KLUCFBGY\\6215945.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\VDFELL8Q\\Charan Kumari et al. - 2012 - Software requirements selection using Quantum-insp.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball","Benchmark testing; Multi-objective Next Release Problem; Quantum-inspired Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm; Search based software engineering; Software requirements selection",null,"IEEE-International Conference On Advances In Engineering, Science And Management (ICAESM -2012)","NO",null,"NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.375,0.714285714,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"Not assigned","Information and communication","Computer programming, consultancy and related activities","Computer programming, consultancy and related activities","Computer programming activities"],["I6836NX2","journalArticle",2011,"Sun, Jun; Fang, Wei; Wu, Xiaojun; Xie, Zhenping; Xu, Wenbo","QoS multicast routing using a quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm",24182.0,null,"Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence",null,"0952-1976","10.1016/j.engappai.2010.08.001","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197610001454","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","J","63","631","6311","QoS multicast routing in networks is a very important research issue in networks and distributed systems.

In this paper, we propose an improved quantum chaotic animal migration optimization algorithm to solve the multicast routing problem (Multi-Constrained Least Cost MCLC). We used a quantum representation of the solutions that allow the use of the original AMO version without discretization, as well as improving AMO by introducing chaotic map to determine the random numbers. These two contributions improve the diversification and intensification of the algorithm. The simulation results show that our proposed algorithm has a good scalability and efficiency compared with other existing algorithms in the literature.","2018","5/4/2022 12:34","5/16/2022 19:11",null,"128-139",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-89743-1_12",null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.777777778,0.733333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"Not assigned","Information and communication","Information service activities","Data processing, hosting and related activities;

A hybrid QIEA is presented for multiple knapsack problem which incorporates several features for better balance between exploration and exploitation. The proposed QIEA, dubbed QIEA-MKP, provides significantly improved performance over simple QIEA from both the perspectives viz., the quality of solutions and computational effort required to reach the best solution.

Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA), which originates from the organic integration of quantum computing and genetic algorithms, has the advantages of outstanding ability to seek optimal solutions, faster computing speed and smaller overall computing scale, and can solve multi-objective scheduling or optimization problems well. In this paper, the QGA's principle, method and basic flow is introduced, the constraints of the complex curriculum arrangement problem is discussed, and a method to solve the problem of course scheduling in colleges and universities by using this advanced algorithm is also given.

Now, one major drawback of the available models is that they consider the amount of carbon emission associated with various inventory processes like setup process, production process, inventory holding process, etc. as fixed numbers. However, these quantities may not be fixed in reality due to several factors, like the condition of the carbon filtrating apparatus in the production firm, machine breakdown, quality of the raw material, nature of the fuel or energy used, etc. The parameters may vary in between some certain ranges. This paper aims at developing an imperfect production inventory model under the various carbon emission regulatory policies where the various carbon emission parameters are interval numbers. The various inventory cost parameters are also represented as interval numbers to reflect the practical situation. The demand of the product is assumed to be a linearly decreasing function of the selling price of the product. Also, the idea of a new inventory cost component, referred to as the \u2018development cost\u2019 is introduced. Four different policies- simple tax policy, cap and purchase policy, cap and reward policy and strictly under permitted cap policy are discussed, and based on those policies four different inventory models are developed. The Quantum behaved Particle Swarm Optimization(QPSO) algorithm has been applied to find the optimal profit of the manufacturer. The optimal profit obtained here is also an interval number which is quite realistic. The traditional fuzzy or probabilistic approach to represent impreciseness fails to find such kind of solution. A numerical example for every case has been given to illustrate the applicability of the models.

The analyses suggest that the good solutions are clustered in the search space and there is a correlation between the \ufb01tness of a local optimum and its distance to the best solution. Inspired by these \ufb01ndings, a new operator for Quantum Evolutionary Algorithms is proposed which, during the search process, collects information about the \ufb01tness landscape and tried to capture the backbone structure of the landscape. The knowledge it has collected is used to guide the search process towards a better region in the search space. The proposed algorithm consists of two phases. The \ufb01rst phase uses a tabu mechanism to collect information about the \ufb01tness landscape. In the second phase, the collected data are processed to guide the algorithm towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm clusters the good solutions it has found in its previous search process. Then when the population is converged and trapped in a local optimum, it is divided into sub-populations and each sub-population is designated to a cluster. The information in the database is then used to reinitialize the q-individuals, so they represent better regions in the search space. This way the population maintains diversity and by capturing the \ufb01tness landscape structure, the algorithm is guided towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm is compared with some state-ofthe-art algorithms from PATAT competition conferences and experimental results are presented.","2021-04","5/4/2022 14:30","5/13/2022 22:40","5/4/2022 14:30","114211",null,null,"168",null,"Expert Systems with Applications","How to exploit fitness landscape properties of timetabling problem",null,null,null,null,null,null,"en",null,null,null,null,"DOI.org (Crossref)",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\AKDUX97Q\\Najaran - 2021 - How to exploit fitness landscape properties of tim.pdf",null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.875,0.6,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",2.07,null,"Professional, scientific and technical activities","Activities of head offices;

The results show that the QPSO algorithm can traverse and search for a task allocation plan with shorter path and less energy consumption for multiple AUV systems under the same constraints, so that the task allocation can reach the global optimal.

The route planning for UAV on the sea is formulated as an optimization problem. A simple method of pretreatment to the terrain environment is proposed. A novel route planner for UAV is designed to generate a safe and flyable path in the presence of different threat environments based on the DEQPSO algorithm. To show the high performance of the proposed method, the DEQPSO algorithm is compared with the real-valued genetic algorithm, DE, standard particle swarm optimization (PSO), hybrid particle swarm with differential evolution operator, and QPSO in terms of the solution quality, robustness, and the convergence property. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of generating higher quality paths efficiently for UAV than any other tested optimization algorithms.","2013-11","4/24/2022 18:00","5/12/2022 16:05",null,"1451-1465",null,"6","43",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\TU2YN2ZA\\6525428.html;

It arises in practical applications where a set of physical locations need to be equipped with services to satisfy demand within a certain area, while minimizing costs. In this paper we formulate the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, apply the hybrid framework of the D-Wave quantum annealer to solve it, and investigate the feasibility of this approach. To improve the often suboptimal initial solutions found on the D-Wave system, we develop a hybrid quantum/classical optimization algorithm that starts from the seed solution and iteratively creates small subproblems that are more efficiently solved on the D-Wave but often still converge to feasible and improved solutions of the original problem. Finally we suggest some opportunities for increasing the accuracy and performance of our algorithm.","2020","5/11/2022 15:39","5/16/2022 14:41",null,"531-545",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-50433-5_41",null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.666666667,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"A","Public administration and defence; compulsory social security","Public administration and defence; compulsory social security","Administration of the State and the economic and social policy of the community","Regulation of and contribution to more efficient operation of businesses"]],"hovertemplate":"<b>S<sub>R</sub>: %{x}</b><br>S<sub>S</sub>: %{customdata[81]}<br>DOI: %{customdata[10]}<br>ISIC Section: %{customdata[96]}","marker":{"outliercolor":"black"},"meanline":{"color":"black","visible":true},"name":"O","points":"all","x":[0.733333333,0.666666667,0.5,0.6,0.666666667],"type":"violin"}],                        {"template":{"data":{"pie":[{"automargin":true,"type":"pie"}]},"layout":{"xaxis":{"showgrid":true,"title":{"standoff":15}},"yaxis":{"showgrid":true,"title":{"standoff":15}}}},"xaxis":{"range":[0,1],"title":{"text":"$S_R$"}},"yaxis":{"title":{"text":"ISIC Section"}},"showlegend":false},                        {"responsive": true}                    )                };                            </script>        </div></div>

Most often software product developments are iterative and incremental in their nature, due to the changes in the customer requirements from time to time. It is a challenging task to select the requirements from a large number of candidates, for the accomplishment of the business goals. The problem is to identify a set of requirements to be included in the next release of the product, by minimizing the cost and maximizing the customer satisfaction. Since minimizing the total cost and maximizing the customer satisfaction are contradictory objectives, the problem has a multi-objective nature. This problem is NP-hard in its nature and so it cannot be solved efficiently by using traditional optimization techniques for large problem instances. QEMEA combines the best features of Evolutionary Algorithms and Quantum Computing. It employs the concepts of Quantum computing such as superposition and interference. The features of QEMEA help in achieving quality pareto-optimal front solutions and faster convergence while using a small population size. The performance of QEMEA is tested on six benchmark problems derived from the literature. The obtained results indicates consistent and superior performance of the algorithm.","2012-03","4/24/2022 22:18","5/4/2022 12:40",null,"782-787",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\KLUCFBGY\\6215945.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\VDFELL8Q\\Charan Kumari et al. - 2012 - Software requirements selection using Quantum-insp.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball","Benchmark testing; Multi-objective Next Release Problem; Quantum-inspired Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm; Search based software engineering; Software requirements selection",null,"IEEE-International Conference On Advances In Engineering, Science And Management (ICAESM -2012)","NO",null,"NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.375,0.714285714,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"Not assigned","Information and communication","Computer programming, consultancy and related activities","Computer programming, consultancy and related activities","Computer programming activities"],["A43GXD2L","conferencePaper",2012,"Zhen-xin, Ma; Yue-guang, Li","A New Algorithm and its Application",null,null,"2012 International Conference on Computer Distributed Control and Intelligent Environmental Monitoring",null,null,"10.1109/CDCIEM.2012.17",null,"Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Ant Colony Algorithm",null,null,"Conference","E","38","381","3811","City Litter Transportation Problem (CLTP) is NP-complete problem, most of the algorithms for CLTP are intelligence algorithm and linear programming.

Inspired by strong non-linear learning capability of support vector regression (SVR), this paper presents an SVR model hybridized with the differential empirical mode decomposition (DEMD) method and quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm (QPSO) for electric load forecasting. The DEMD method is employed to decompose the electric load to several detail parts associated with high frequencies (intrinsic mode function-IMF) and an approximate part associated with low frequencies. Hybridized with quantum theory to enhance particle searching performance, the so-called QPSO is used to optimize the parameters of SVR. The electric load data of the New South Wales (Sydney, Australia) market and the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO, New York, USA) are used for comparing the forecasting performances of different forecasting models. The results illustrate the validity of the idea that the proposed model can simultaneously provide forecasting with good accuracy and interpretability.","2016-03","4/11/2022 15:14","5/12/2022 16:15",null,"221 (20 pp.)",null,"3","9",null,"Energies",null,"Energies (Switzerland)",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Place: Switzerland Publisher: MDPI AG",null,";

This paper proposes a novel technique for accurate failure prognosis based on back propagation neural network and quantum multi-agent algorithm. Inspired by the extensive research of quantum computing theory and multi-agent systems, the technique employs a quantum multi-agent strategy, with the main characteristics of quantum agent representation and several operations including fitness evaluation, cooperation, crossover and mutation, for parameters optimization of neural network to avoid the deficiencies such as slow convergence and liability of getting stuck to local minima. To validate the feasibility of the proposed approach, several numerical approximation experiments were firstly designed, after which real vibrational data of bearings from the Laboratory of Cincinnati University were analyzed and used to assess the health condition for a given future point. The results were rather encouraging and indicated that the presented forecasting method has the potential to be utilized as an estimation tool for failure prediction in industrial machinery.","2016-06-01","5/5/2022 18:26","5/16/2022 21:07","5/5/2022 18:26","210-228",null,"2","25",null,"J.

In this paper, we present a real-world application that uses quantum technologies. Specifically, we show how to map certain parts of a real-world traffic flow optimization problem to be suitable for quantum annealing. We show that time-critical optimization tasks, such as continuous redistribution of position data for cars in dense road networks, are suitable candidates for quantum computing. Due to the limited size and connectivity of current-generation D-Wave QPUs, we use a hybrid quantum and classical approach to solve the traffic flow problem.","2017","4/24/2022 18:26","5/13/2022 22:04","4/24/2022 18:26",null,null,null,"4",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Frontiers",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\CTK8HSJK\\Neukart et al. - 2017 - Traffic Flow Optimization Using a Quantum Annealer.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball",null,null,null,"YES","NO","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.625,0.733333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Not assigned","Not assigned",null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Other transportation support activities"],["6WU267MY","journalArticle",2017,"Feng, Zhong-kai; Niu, Wen-jing; Cheng, Chun-tian","Multi-objective quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization for economic environmental hydrothermal energy system scheduling",29348.0,null,"Energy",null,"0360-5442","10.1016/j.energy.2017.05.013","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544217307582","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","D","35","351","3510","With increasing attention paid to energy and environment in recent years, the hydrothermal scheduling considering economic and environmental objectives is becoming one of the most important optimization problems in power system. With two competing objectives and a set of operation constraints, the economic environmental hydrothermal scheduling problem is classified as a typical multi-objective nonlinear constrained optimization problem. Thus, in order to efficiently resolve this problem, the multi-objective quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (MOQPSO) is presented in this paper. In MOQPSO, the elite archive set is adopted to conserve Pareto optimal solutions and provide multiple evolutionary directions for individuals, while the neighborhood searching and chaotic mutation strategies are used to enhance the search capability and diversity of population. Furthermore, a novel constraint handling method is designed to adjust the constraint violation of hydro and thermal plants, respectively. In order to verify its effectiveness, the MOQPSO is applied to a classical hydrothermal system with four hydropower plants and three thermal plants. The simulations show that the proposed method has competitive performance compared with several traditional methods.","2017-07-15","4/26/2022 13:59","5/12/2022 16:09","4/26/2022 13:59","165-178",null,null,"131",null,"Energy",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"en",null,null,null,null,"ScienceDirect",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\P465LNLR\\Feng et al. - 2017 - Multi-objective quantum-behaved particle swarm opt.pdf;

Economic dispatch problem refers to the minimization of generation cost, where environmental dispatch problem refers to the minimization of emission of pollutants like CO2, SO2, and NOx from the power generation system. A quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization (QPSO) technique is presented in this paper to solve many-objective environmental economic dispatch (EED) problems. Emissions of CO2, SO2, and NOx are considered 3 different objectives, thus making it a 4-objective problem considering ED. Many-objective EED problems are defined by using a cubic criterion function, and a max/max price penalty factor is considered to convert all the objectives into a single objective to compare the final results with other well-known methods found in the literature like Lagrangian relaxation, particle swarm optimization, simulated annealing, and quantum-behaved bat algorithm. Quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization is implemented on a 6-unit system to solve many-objective EED problems, and at the same time, to show the effectiveness of QPSO in large systems, it is also implemented in a 26-unit power generation system for ED problem. The obtained results demonstrate and verify the effectiveness and robustness of QPSO to solve many-objective EED problems. This also shows that QPSO can effectively be implemented in such power dispatch problems.","2018","4/27/2022 16:24","5/11/2022 15:55","4/27/2022 16:24","e2497",null,"3","28",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"en",null,null,null,null,"Wiley Online Library",null,"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/etep.2497",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\RKHCJZ95\\Mahdi et al. - 2018 - A quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization app.pdf",null,"included;

We used a quantum representation of the solutions that allow the use of the original AMO version without discretization, as well as improving AMO by introducing chaotic map to determine the random numbers.

However the resulting spin configurations are not always in the ground state. It can rather quickly generate many spin configurations following the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution. In the present study, we formulate an Ising model to control a large number of automated guided vehicles in a factory without collision. We deal with an actual factory in Japan, in which vehicles run, and assess efficiency of our formulation.

In this work we investigate the solvability of this problem with a D-Wave quantum annealer. These machines are optimizers for quadratic unconstrained optimization problems (QUBO). Therefore the flight gate assignment problem seems to be well suited for these machines. We use real world data from a mid-sized German airport as well as simulation based data to extract typical instances small enough to be amenable to the D-Wave machine. In order to mitigate precision problems, we employ bin packing on the passenger numbers to reduce the precision requirements of the extracted instances. We find that, for the instances we investigated, the bin packing has little effect on the solution quality. Hence, we were able to solve small problem instances extracted from real data with the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer.","2019","4/25/2022 14:01","5/13/2022 22:04",null,"99-110",null,null,null,null,null,null,"Lecture Notes in Computer Science",null,null,null,"Springer International Publishing","Cham","en",null,null,null,null,"Springer Link",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\2MYGAWJY\\Stollenwerk et al. - 2019 - Flight Gate Assignment with a Quantum Annealer.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball","Quantum annealing; Airport planning; Quadratic assignment problem; QUBO","Feld, Sebastian; Linnhoff-Popien, Claudia",null,"NO",null,"YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES",null,"NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.571428571,0.642857143,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Service activities incidental to air transportation"],["BBWF6N2E","conferencePaper",2019,"Liu, Bo; Wang, Xiaoping","UAV Route Planning Based on QPSO Algorithm under Rolling Time Domain Control",null,null,"2019 2nd World Conference on Mechanical Engineering and Intelligent Manufacturing (WCMEIM)",null,null,"10.1109/WCMEIM48965.2019.00130",null,"Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Conference","H","52","522","5229","Aiming at the path planning problem of UAVs in complex environments, a RHC-QPSO path planning algorithm is proposed based on the quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm.

The numerical experiments of 17 classical test functions indicate that the presented method can achieve satisfactory results in both convergence speed and global search ability.

NSP seeks the optimal assignment for a set of nurses to shifts under an accompanying set of constraints on schedule and personnel. After reducing NSP to a novel Ising-type Hamiltonian, we evaluate the solution quality obtained from the D-Wave 2000Q against the constraint requirements as well as the diversity of solutions.

Therefore, it is of great significance to extract the useful fault features and diagnose faults based on raw vibration signals. In this paper, a novel deep feature learning method based on the fused-stacked autoencoders (AEs) for planetary gear fault diagnosis was proposed. First, to improve the data learning ability and the robustness of feature extraction process of AE model, the sparse autoencoder (SAE) and the contractive autoencoder (CAE) were studied, respectively. Then, the quantum ant colony algorithm (QACA) was used to optimize the specific location and key parameters of SAEs and CAEs in deep learning architecture, and multiple SAEs and multiple CAEs were stacked alternately to form a novel deep learning architecture, which gave the deep learning architecture better data learning ability and robustness of feature extraction. The experimental results show that the proposed method can address the raw vibration signals of planetary gear. Compared with other deep learning architectures and shallow learning architecture, the proposed method has better diagnosis performance, and it is an effective method of deep feature learning and fault diagnosis.","2019-01","5/11/2022 15:42","5/16/2022 18:44","5/11/2022 15:42","4522",null,"23","12",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",null,null,null,"www.mdpi.com",null,"Number: 23 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\NBX76F2T\\Chen et al. - 2019 - A Novel Deep Feature Learning Method Based on the .pdf;

In reality, demand of a certain product becomes highly effected by on-hand stock level in stores and the selling price of the product. In the proposed model, demand of the product is dependent on these two vital deceive factors. In real life production systems, always there are some defective products which requires reworking in order to make them useful. The possibility of producing some defective items in regular production process and their reworking has been taken into account in the model. In case of inventories of highly demandable products, it is observed that production rate is proportional to demand. The situation also arises in case of launching a new product or in a multi-stage production system. In this model, production rate is a variable and it varies with the demand rate. Shortages are allowed and it is backlogged fully. Based on these assumptions, several researchers worked on but they considered that the associated inventory cost parameters are fixed real numbers. However, these are not fixed in reality and may vary time to time depending upon some scenario. Main objective of the paper is to develop a production inventory model under those assumptions considering various cost parameters as interval numbers. As a result the corresponding optimization problem is also interval valued. Quantum behaved particle swarm optimization technique has been applied to find the maximum profit in a single cycle. Numerical example and sensitivity analysis are given to illustrate the proposed inventory model.  2019, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.","2020","4/11/2022 15:14","5/4/2022 11:23",null,"385-399",null,"2","11",null,"International Journal of Systems Assurance Engineering and Management",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Publisher: Springer",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\TY5WT3EX\\Ruidas et al. - 2020 - An EPQ model with stock and selling price dependen.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13198-019-00867-w","Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Numerical methods; Sensitivity analysis; Inventory control; Defects; included; reverse snowball; forward snowball",null,null,null,"NO",null,"NO","YES",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.25,0.857142857,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q3",0.3,null,"Manufacturing","Manufacture of leather and related products","Tanning and dressing of leather; manufacture of luggage, handbags, saddlery and harness; dressing and dyeing of fur","Manufacture of luggage, handbags and the like, saddlery and harness"],["EEM6Q2MC","journalArticle",2020,"Wang, Yongli; Song, Fuhao; Ma, Yuze; Zhang, Yuli; Yang, Jiale; Liu, Yang; Zhang, Fuwei; Zhu, Jinrong","Research on capacity planning and optimization of regional integrated energy system based on hybrid energy storage system",13688.0,null,"Applied Thermal Engineering",null,"1359-4311","10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2020.115834","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359431120333160","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Genetic Algorithm",null,null,"Journal","D","35","351","3510","Some regional integrated energy systems (RIES) have installed equipments such as wind turbine and photovoltaic, but the fluctuation of these intermittent power supply is large, resulting in a certain amount of energy waste.

In this model, the wavelet packet decomposition method is used to reasonably decompose the high-frequency fluctuation and low-frequency fluctuation of renewable energy to achieve the function of stabilizing fluctuation. Meanwhile, an operation strategy for hybrid energy storage to participate in demand response is proposed. Rain flow counting method is used to research the life of hybrid energy storage system, which improves the accuracy of energy storage annual cost calculation. In the Simulation and Analysis section, the genetic quantum algorithm is used for simulation and analysis of the role and benefits of hybrid energy storage.

The mapping is performed through an original representation of the conflict-resolution problem in terms of a conflict graph, where the nodes of the graph represent flights and the edges represent a potential conflict between flights. The representation allows a natural decomposition of a real-world instance related to wind-optimal trajectories over the Atlantic Ocean into smaller subproblems that can be discretized and are amenable to be programmed in quantum annealers. In this paper, we tested the new programming techniques, and we benchmark the hardness of the instances using both classical solvers and the D-Wave 2X and D-Wave 2000Q quantum chip. The preliminary results show that for reasonable modeling choices, the most challenging subproblems which are programmable in the current devices are solved to optimality with 99% of probability within a second of annealing time.","2020-01","4/25/2022 14:01","5/13/2022 22:04",null,"285-297",null,"1","21",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\PHKJEJMB\\8643733.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\XIFDSBNL\\Stollenwerk et al. - 2020 - Quantum Annealing Applied to De-Conflicting Optima.pdf; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\H9EC435K\\Stollenwerk et al. - 2020 - Quantum Annealing Applied to De-Conflicting Optima.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball","Optimization; Annealing; Quantum computing; Fuels; Quantum Physics; Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms; Trajectory; Air traffic management; classical optimization; Delays; NASA; optimal trajectories; quantum optimization",null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.75,0.8,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",1.591,null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Service activities incidental to air transportation"],["ITNK88F2","conferencePaper",2020,"Sheng, Jiangfan; Kong, Weijian; Qi, Jie","Process optimization of carbon fiber precursor spinning coagulation process based on surrogate model",null,null,"2020 Chinese Automation Congress (CAC)",null,null,"10.1109/CAC51589.2020.9326779",null,"Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Conference","C","23","239","2399","High-quality carbon fiber precursor is the key to the manufacture of high-performance carbon fiber, and the coagulation process is one of the key steps in the preparation of the precursor. This coagulation process is an industrial process with complex mechanism and strict control accuracy requirements. Therefore, iterative optimization based on its strict mechanism model will be much time-consuming. In order to reduce the computational cost, a process optimization method for the coagulation process of carbon liber precursor spinning based on surrogate model was proposed. Using meta-modeling technology, this paper constructs the surrogate model which describes the relationship between the key operating parameters and the main output variables in the coagulation process. In the process of constructing the surrogate model, an evolutionary optimal sample point insertion criterion is adopted to improve the accuracy of the model. And the quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is applied for searching operating parameters in the design space. The simulation results show that the proposed method not only provides a group of satisfactory operating parameters, but also greatly reduces the calculation cost.","2020-11","4/11/2022 15:14","5/12/2022 15:41",null,"6816-6821",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"ISSN: 2688-0938",null,"; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\KN7RFETR\\9326779.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\5S56PYE9\\9326779.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\UESCYFJ7\\Sheng et al. - 2020 - Process optimization of carbon fiber precursor spi.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CAC51589.2020.9326779","included; reverse snowball; forward snowball","Coagulation; Carbon; Mathematical model; Computational modeling; Particle swarm optimization; Process control; carbon fiber precursor; coagulation process; evolutionary optimal sample point insertion criterion; quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization; Spinning; surrogate model",null,"2020 Chinese Automation Congress (CAC)","YES","NO","YES",null,null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.5,0.466666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"Not assigned","Manufacturing","Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products","Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c.","Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products n.e.c."],["EZS8SFEW","journalArticle",2020,"Xin-gang, Zhao; Ji, Liang; Jin, Meng; Ying, Zhou","An improved quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm for environmental economic dispatch",24201.0,null,"Expert Systems with Applications",null,"0957-4174","10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113370","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417420301950","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","D","35","351","3510","Consumption of traditional fossil energy has promoted rapid economic development and caused effects such as climate warming and environmental degradation. In order to solve the problem of environmental economic dispatch (EED), this paper proposes a DE-CQPSO (Differential Evolution-Crossover Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization) algorithm based on the fast convergence of differential evolution algorithms and the particle diversity of crossover operators of genetic algorithms. In order to obtain better optimization results, a parameter adaptive control method is used to update the crossover probability. And the problem of multi-objective optimization is solved by introducing a penalty factor. The experimental results show that: the evaluation index and convergence speed of the DE-CQPSO algorithm are better than QPSO (Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization) and other algorithms, whether it is single-objective optimization of fuel cost and emissions or multi-objective optimization considering both optimization objectives. A good compromise value is verified, which verifies the effectiveness and robustness of the DE-CQPSO algorithm in solving environmental economic dispatch problems. The study provides a new research direction for solving environmental economic dispatch problems. At the same time, it provides a reference for the reasonable output of the unit to a certain extent.","2020-08-15","4/27/2022 16:02","5/12/2022 15:37","4/27/2022 16:02","113370",null,null,"152",null,"Expert Systems with Applications",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"en",null,null,null,null,"ScienceDirect",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\XVM6QIPE\\Xin-gang et al. - 2020 - An improved quantum particle swarm optimization al.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball","Quantum particle swarm optimization; Crossover operator; Adaptive control; Carbon emission reduction; Differential evolution operator; Environmental economic dispatch",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.666666667,0.6,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",1.368,null,"Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution"],["Q6HA4KL8","journalArticle",2020,"Wang, Ziteng; Hu, Zhiyuan; Tang, Yuanjie","Float-Based Resource Leveling Optimization of Linear Projects",21100374601.0,null,"IEEE Access",null,null,"10.1109/access.2020.3027058","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131293130","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","F","41","410","4100","In recent years, the linear scheduling method (LSM) approach to the linear project scheduling optimization problem has been widely studied by researchers.

Firstly, the concept of a third type of float is proposed, and the advantages of this third type of float to the optimization of linear project resource leveling are analyzed. On this basis, a two-stage optimization process of the linear project resource leveling problem based on the third type of float is proposed. The process takes into account new constraints such as total resource constraint, resource utilization constraint, and construction mileage constraint, and it aims to maximize the space-time flexibility of construction activities and realize the depth optimization of linear project resource leveling. According to the integer nonlinear characteristic of the model, a quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm with a constraint processing mechanism and particle search range restriction is designed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model is verified by case analysis and comparison of the results in previous studies.","2020","5/3/2022 16:13","5/15/2022 18:51",null,"176997-177020",null,null,"8",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\AGUAJ3LJ\\9207731.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\FPWAKFEV\\Wang et al. - 2020 - Float-Based Resource Leveling Optimization of Line.pdf",null,"included","Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; project management; Resource management; Schedules; Optimal scheduling; Acceleration; Linear project; optimal scheduling; quantum particle swarm; resource leveling",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.666666667,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",0.587,null,"Construction","Construction of buildings","Construction of buildings","Construction of buildings"],["8FYDFGES","conferencePaper",2020,"James, Scott; Raheb, Robert; Hudak, Allison","UAV Swarm Path Planning",null,null,"2020 Integrated Communications Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS)",null,null,"10.1109/ICNS50378.2020.9223005",null,"Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization",null,null,"Conference","H","52","522","5223","We present an algorithm for the modeling and management of groups of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV).

In this paper we formulate the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, apply the hybrid framework of the D-Wave quantum annealer to solve it, and investigate the feasibility of this approach. To improve the often suboptimal initial solutions found on the D-Wave system, we develop a hybrid quantum/classical optimization algorithm that starts from the seed solution and iteratively creates small subproblems that are more efficiently solved on the D-Wave but often still converge to feasible and improved solutions of the original problem. Finally we suggest some opportunities for increasing the accuracy and performance of our algorithm.","2020","5/11/2022 15:39","5/16/2022 14:41",null,"531-545",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-50433-5_41",null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.666666667,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"A","Public administration and defence;

In this paper we propose to leverage their capabilities to address an important task for recommender systems providers, the optimal selection of recommendation carousels. In many video-on-demand and music streaming services the user is provided with a homepage containing several recommendation lists, i.e., carousels, each built with a certain criteria (e.g., artist, mood, Action movies etc.). Choosing which set of carousels to display is a difficult problem because it needs to account for how the different recommendation lists interact, e.g., avoiding duplicate recommendations, and how they help the user explore the catalogue. We focus in particular on the adiabatic computing paradigm and use the D-Wave quantum annealer, which is able to solve NP-hard optimization problems, can be programmed by classical operations research tools and is freely available on the cloud. We propose a formulation of the carousel selection problem for black box recommenders, that can be solved effectively on a quantum annealer and has the advantage of being simple.

How to control the traffic flow to mitigate the congestion has been one of the central issues in transportation research. In this study, we employ a quantum annealing approach to optimize the traffic signals control at a real-life intersection with mixed traffic flows of vehicles and scooters. Considering traffic flow is a continuous and emerging phenomenon, we used quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formalism for traffic optimization, which has a natural equivalence to the Ising model and can be solved efficiently on the quantum annealers, quantum computers or digital annealers. In this article, we first applied the QUBO traffic optimization to artificially generated traffic for a simple intersection, and then we used real-time traffic data to simulate a real \"Dongda-Keyuan\" intersection with dedicated cars and scooter lanes, as well as mixed scooter and car lanes. We introduced two types of traffic light control systems for traffic optimization: C-QUBO and QUBO. Our rigorous QUBO optimizations show that C-QUBO and QUBO outperform the commonly used fixed cycle method, with QUBO outperforming C-QUBO in some instances. It has been found that QUBO optimization significantly relieves traffic congestion for the unbalanced traffic volume. Furthermore, we found that dynamic changes in traffic light signal duration greatly reduce traffic congestion.","2021-11","5/3/2022 15:49","5/13/2022 22:06",null,"74-81",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"ISSN: 2693-8421",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\S84X95F3\\9704985.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\L2YQSACW\\9704985.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\3ZULA6CL\\Singh et al. - 2021 - Quantum Annealing Approach for the Optimal Real-ti.pdf",null,"included","Annealing; Quantum annealing; Urban areas; Motorcycles; Real-time systems; quantum computing; quantum annealing; Correlation; QUBO; real-time optimization; Roads; traffic optimization; traffic signal control",null,"2021 IEEE/ACIS 22nd International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD)","YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.75,0.8,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"C","Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Other transportation support activities"],["BJ2HEZHS","conferencePaper",2021,"Pushpabala, V.; ChristoberAsirRajan, C.","Energy Efficient Based Optimized Renewable Energy Systems (ORES) Using QPSO Technique for Normalized Cost of Energy (NCE)",null,null,"2021 International Conference on System, Computation, Automation and Networking (ICSCAN)",null,null,"10.1109/ICSCAN53069.2021.9526488",null,"Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Conference","D","35","351","3510","Numbers and charts of the world renewable energy agency and the International Energy Agency have lately shown that renewable energy sources (RES) have exceeded natural gas and have taken second place as a power source.

A novel hybrid multi-step-ahead forecast model is introduced to solve this problem. Partial autocorrelation function (PACF) is first used to analyze the characteristics of the target time series for extracting the appropriate input variables. Least-square support vector machine (LSSVM) with recursive mechanism is then explored for modelling multi-step-ahead forecasts, in which the forecast model is adjusted adaptively as long as new information is updated. The parameters in LSSVM are optimized based on an improved quantum-inspired version of Grey Wolf Optimizer (QGWO). The QGWO fortifies against the stagnation of the wolves at an optimal local point using three strategies including the quantum operator, non-linear convergence factor, and dynamic weighting. In this paper, the performance of QGWO was first demonstrated with that of other meta-heuristic (MH) algorithms in solving eight mathematical benchmark problems. Two time series of reservoir water availability in Zhoushan Islands, China, were then provided and analyzed to validate the performance of the advanced forecast approach in multi-step-ahead forecasts. The forecasts were compared with those obtained by the non-adaptive (NA) and non-recursive (NR) models. Results indicate that (1) QGWO displays superior performance on model parameters optimization than other comparative MH algorithms; (2) The proposed hybrid model in consideration of the nearest anterior feedback, as well as the adaptive mechanism, not only outperforms the two comparative models (NA, NR) but significantly enhances the accuracy of multi-step-ahead forecasts for non-stationary time series and low or high volume events, even as the forecast time horizon increases.","2021","5/3/2022 16:13","5/15/2022 16:40",null,"125769",null,null,"597",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\IUR5G3PH\\Guo et al. - 2021 - Multi-step-ahead forecast of reservoir water avail.pdf",null,"included","Adaptive and recursive mechanism; Island areas; Multi-step-ahead forecast; Quantum Grey Wolf Optimizer (QGWO); Reservoir water availability",null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.75,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",1.611,null,"Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities","Water collection, treatment and supply","Water collection, treatment and supply","Water collection, treatment and supply"],["DQ54M769","journalArticle",2021,"Bodha, Kapil Deo; Yadav, Vinod Kumar; Mukherjee, Vivekananda","A novel quantum inspired hybrid metaheuristic for dispatch of power system including solar photovoltaic generation",4700152713.0,null,"Energy Sources, Part B: Economics, Planning, and Policy",null,null,"10.1080/15567249.2021.1933265","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138664786","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum-inspired Binary TVIW-GSA-PSO",null,null,"Journal","D","35","351","3510","This manuscript proposes a novel metaheuristic, which is an amalgamation of the quantum concept and the gravitational search particle swarm optimization technique.

Now, one major drawback of the available models is that they consider the amount of carbon emission associated with various inventory processes like setup process, production process, inventory holding process, etc. as fixed numbers. However, these quantities may not be fixed in reality due to several factors, like the condition of the carbon filtrating apparatus in the production firm, machine breakdown, quality of the raw material, nature of the fuel or energy used, etc. The parameters may vary in between some certain ranges. This paper aims at developing an imperfect production inventory model under the various carbon emission regulatory policies where the various carbon emission parameters are interval numbers. The various inventory cost parameters are also represented as interval numbers to reflect the practical situation. The demand of the product is assumed to be a linearly decreasing function of the selling price of the product. Also, the idea of a new inventory cost component, referred to as the \u2018development cost\u2019 is introduced. Four different policies- simple tax policy, cap and purchase policy, cap and reward policy and strictly under permitted cap policy are discussed, and based on those policies four different inventory models are developed. The Quantum behaved Particle Swarm Optimization(QPSO) algorithm has been applied to find the optimal profit of the manufacturer. The optimal profit obtained here is also an interval number which is quite realistic. The traditional fuzzy or probabilistic approach to represent impreciseness fails to find such kind of solution. A numerical example for every case has been given to illustrate the applicability of the models. Finally, sensitivity analysis of the optimal feasible solution due to variation in some key parameters has been provided with the key managerial insights.","2021-04-01","5/4/2022 11:21","5/18/2022 11:46","5/4/2022 11:21","107154",null,null,"154",null,"Computers & Industrial Engineering",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"en",null,null,null,null,"ScienceDirect",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\ISRLT4XK\\Ruidas et al. - 2021 - A production inventory model with interval-valued .pdf",null,"included","Sustainable production; Imperfect production system; Interval number; Inventory model; Quantum behaved particle swarm optimization technique",null,null,"NO",null,"YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","NO","YES","NO","NO","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.571428571,0.571428571,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",1.775,null,"Professional, scientific and technical activities","Activities of head offices; management consultancy activities","Activities of head offices","Activities of head offices"],["8W6YGRSC","journalArticle",2021,"Shahrabi, E.; Hakimi, S.M.; Hasankhani, A.; Derakhshan, G.; Abdi, B.","Developing optimal energy management of energy hub in the presence of stochastic renewable energy resources",21100371258.0,null,"Sustainable Energy, Grids and Networks",null,null,"10.1016/j.segan.2020.100428","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099229897&doi=10.1016%2fj.segan.2020.100428&partnerID=40&md5=6ed16a65c9d451ad81753c0a11decab0","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","D","35","351","3510",null,"2021","5/4/2022 11:37","5/13/2022 22:07",null,null,null,null,"26",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Scopus",null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\VTY3GGMH\\Shahrabi et al. - 2021 - Developing optimal energy management of energy hub.pdf",null,"included","Energy hub; Energy storage system; Optimal planning and scheduling; Renewable energy system",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.666666667,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",1.2,null,"Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","Electric power generation, transmission and distribution"],["MXVUMVPM","conferencePaper",2021,"Henderson, Jessie M.; O\u2019Malley, Daniel; Viswanathan, Hari S.","Interrogating the performance of quantum annealing for the solution of steady-state subsurface flow",null,null,"2021 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)",null,null,"10.1109/HPEC49654.2021.9622819",null,"Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Conference","E","36","360","3600","In the 1990s, the principles of quantum mechanics were leveraged to describe how discrete combinatorial optimization problems could be solved using a method called quantum annealing.

The analyses suggest that the good solutions are clustered in the search space and there is a correlation between the \ufb01tness of a local optimum and its distance to the best solution. Inspired by these \ufb01ndings, a new operator for Quantum Evolutionary Algorithms is proposed which, during the search process, collects information about the \ufb01tness landscape and tried to capture the backbone structure of the landscape. The knowledge it has collected is used to guide the search process towards a better region in the search space. The proposed algorithm consists of two phases. The \ufb01rst phase uses a tabu mechanism to collect information about the \ufb01tness landscape. In the second phase, the collected data are processed to guide the algorithm towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm clusters the good solutions it has found in its previous search process. Then when the population is converged and trapped in a local optimum, it is divided into sub-populations and each sub-population is designated to a cluster. The information in the database is then used to reinitialize the q-individuals, so they represent better regions in the search space. This way the population maintains diversity and by capturing the \ufb01tness landscape structure, the algorithm is guided towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm is compared with some state-ofthe-art algorithms from PATAT competition conferences and experimental results are presented.","2021-04","5/4/2022 14:30","5/13/2022 22:40","5/4/2022 14:30","114211",null,null,"168",null,"Expert Systems with Applications","How to exploit fitness landscape properties of timetabling problem",null,null,null,null,null,null,"en",null,null,null,null,"DOI.org (Crossref)",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\AKDUX97Q\\Najaran - 2021 - How to exploit fitness landscape properties of tim.pdf",null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.875,0.6,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",2.07,null,"Professional, scientific and technical activities","Activities of head offices; management consultancy activities","Activities of head offices","Activities of head offices"],["UUUPZZW7","journalArticle",2021,"Zhu, K.; Wang, K.; Zheng, X.; Li, Y.; Liu, J.","Day-ahead optimal strategy for commercial air-conditioning load under time-of-use and demand pricing plan",21100241220.0,null,"International Transactions on Electrical Energy Systems",null,null,"10.1002/2050-7038.12929","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105432898&doi=10.1002%2f2050-7038.12929&partnerID=40&md5=2d2b791e1320bfb0ec8e015f78c9d3ed","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","M","71","711","7110",null,"2021","5/4/2022 14:46","5/13/2022 21:16",null,null,null,"7","31",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Scopus",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.75,0.8,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q2",0.6,null,"Professional, scientific and technical activities","Architectural and engineering activities; technical testing and analysis","Architectural and engineering activities and related technical consultancy","Architectural and engineering activities and related technical consultancy"],["VUUX3YTR","journalArticle",2021,"Wang, Y.; Li, K.; Han, Y.; Yan, X.","Distributed multi-UAV cooperation for dynamic target tracking optimized by an SAQPSO algorithm",29805.0,null,"ISA Transactions",null,null,"10.1016/j.isatra.2021.12.014","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122086191&doi=10.1016%2fj.isatra.2021.12.014&partnerID=40&md5=53e7d5599abb0a6cdd6f85b5a9347063","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","M","71","711","7110",null,"2021","5/4/2022 14:46","5/13/2022 21:32",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Scopus",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","NO","NO","YES",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.444444444,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",1.474,null,"Professional, scientific and technical activities","Architectural and engineering activities; technical testing and analysis","Architectural and engineering activities and related technical consultancy","Architectural and engineering activities and related technical consultancy"],["2R7SJU7Q","bookSection",2021,"Phillipson, F.; Chiscop, I.","Multimodal Container Planning: A QUBO Formulation and Implementation on a Quantum Annealer",null,952.0,"Computational Science \u2013 ICCS 2021",null,null,"10.1007/978-3-030-77980-1_3","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138731251","Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Conference","H","52","522","5229","Quantum computing is developing fast.

The bat algorithm (BA) is an acknowledged metaheuristic optimization algorithm owing to its performance. However, the classical BA presents some weaknesses, such as premature convergence. To withstand the drawbacks of the BA, quantum mechanics theories and Gaussian and Cauchy operators are integrated into the standard BA to enhance its effectiveness. Since the economic load dispatch is a nonlinear, complex and constrained optimization problem, its main objective is to reduce the total generation cost while matching the equality and inequality constraints of the system. The validity of the CGQBA is tested on six standard benchmark functions with different characteristics.

In this paper, in order to comprehensively considere different stakeholders, a three-objective gate allocation model is to consider a wider scope, in which the minimizing passenger walking distances, the most balanced idle time of each gate and the best full use of large gate are optimized simultaneously to improve the practical efficiency. To efficiently solve this model, an improved quantum evolutionary algorithm (QEA) based on the niche co-evolution strategy and enhanced particle swarm optimization (PSO), namely IPOQEA is designed. An IPOQEA-based gate allocation method is proposed to allocate the flights to suitable gates within different periods. Finally, the actual operation data of Baiyun Airport is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Comparison results show that the constructed model can address the passenger walking distances, robustness and costs in airport management. Moreover, the IPOQEA has better optimization ability in solving gate allocation problem. Therefore, the proposed gate allocation method has great potential for practical engineering since it can easily make decisions for airport managers.","2022-03","5/4/2022 10:25","5/13/2022 21:03",null,"1737-1745",null,"3","23",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\SD597D35\\9210735.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\AVL4TNSW\\Deng et al. - 2022 - A Novel Gate Resource Allocation Method Using Impr.pdf",null,"included","Optimization; Logic gates; Airports; Resource management; Statistics; Sociology; Atmospheric modeling; Gate allocation model; improved rotation gates; multi-objective; niche co-evolution strategy; PSO; QEA",null,null,"YES","YES","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.75,0.6,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Not assigned","Not assigned",null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Service activities incidental to air transportation"],["5LY5Q8VP","journalArticle",2022,"Lakshmi, K.; Nagineni, S.; Lydia, E.L.; Devaraj, A.F.S.; Mohanty, S.N.; Pustokhina, I.V.; Pustokhin, D.A.","An Optimal Deep Learning for Cooperative Intelligent Transportation System",24364.0,null,"Computers, Materials and Continua",null,null,"10.32604/cmc.2022.020244","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125716670&doi=10.32604%2fcmc.2022.020244&partnerID=40&md5=91cfdb5dac196e05ee392cae2bd97050","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Bat Algorithm",null,null,"Journal","H","52","522","5229",null,"2022","5/11/2022 16:29","5/12/2022 23:24",null,"19-35",null,"1","72",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Scopus",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.555555556,0.533333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Not assigned","Not assigned",null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Other transportation support activities"],["VC8AN3LH","journalArticle",2022,"Si, Yupeng; Wang, Rongjie; Zhang, Shiqi; Zhou, Wenting; Lin, Anhui; Zeng, Guangmiao","Configuration optimization and energy management of hybrid energy system for marine using quantum computing",29348.0,null,"Energy",null,null,"10.1016/j.energy.2022.124131","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147472544","Classical","Quantum-inspired","Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization",null,null,"Journal","C","27","271","2710","Improving the technology of hybrid energy systems is an important development direction for the greening of ships, it is vital to the hybrid energy system configuration optimization and energy management to enhance the marine electric power system reliability, economic efficiency, and sustainability. Focusing on this problem, this paper has carried out a study on the multi-objective configuration optimization method (COM) and energy management strategy (EMS) for ship hybrid energy systems based on quantum computing. First, the mathematical model of distributed power modules of the hybrid energy system is established, and a configuration optimization objective function that aims at low-cost, long equipment life, and high reliability of power supply is constructed. Then, the combination with fuzzy rules and quantum multi-objective artificial bee colony algorithm to solve the objective function, the configuration scheme satisfying multiple constraints is obtained.

In this paper we propose to leverage their capabilities to address an important task for recommender systems providers, the optimal selection of recommendation carousels. In many video-on-demand and music streaming services the user is provided with a homepage containing several recommendation lists, i.e., carousels, each built with a certain criteria (e.g., artist, mood, Action movies etc.). Choosing which set of carousels to display is a difficult problem because it needs to account for how the different recommendation lists interact, e.g., avoiding duplicate recommendations, and how they help the user explore the catalogue. We focus in particular on the adiabatic computing paradigm and use the D-Wave quantum annealer, which is able to solve NP-hard optimization problems, can be programmed by classical operations research tools and is freely available on the cloud. We propose a formulation of the carousel selection problem for black box recommenders, that can be solved effectively on a quantum annealer and has the advantage of being simple.

In the present study, we formulate an Ising model to control a large number of automated guided vehicles in a factory without collision.

In this work we investigate the solvability of this problem with a D-Wave quantum annealer. These machines are optimizers for quadratic unconstrained optimization problems (QUBO). Therefore the flight gate assignment problem seems to be well suited for these machines. We use real world data from a mid-sized German airport as well as simulation based data to extract typical instances small enough to be amenable to the D-Wave machine. In order to mitigate precision problems, we employ bin packing on the passenger numbers to reduce the precision requirements of the extracted instances. We find that, for the instances we investigated, the bin packing has little effect on the solution quality.

We examine a number of scenarios and compare the impact of communication latency on the intra-swarm and inter-swarm separations.","2020-09","5/4/2022 10:22","5/15/2022 20:57",null,"2G3-1-2G3-12",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEEE Xplore",null,"ISSN: 2155-4951",null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\N982K4BP\\9223005.html; C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\7VB7GKAT\\James et al. - 2020 - UAV Swarm Path Planning.pdf",null,"included","Computational modeling; Aircraft; Atmospheric modeling; Path planning; ATM; UTM; Autonomous aerial vehicles; Navigation; Surveillance; Swarm; UAV",null,"2020 Integrated Communications Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS)","NO",null,"YES",null,null,"YES","NO",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","NO","NO","NO","NO","YES",null,"NO",null,"YES","YES","NO","NO",null,"NO",0.5,0.230769231,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"Not assigned","Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Service activities incidental to air transportation"],["B7QM3W94","journalArticle",2019,"Ikeda, Kazuki; Nakamura, Yuma; Humble, Travis S.","Application of Quantum Annealing to Nurse Scheduling Problem",21100200805.0,null,"Scientific Reports",null,null,"10.1038/s41598-019-49172-3","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120878833","Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Journal","Q","86","861","8610","Quantum annealing is a promising heuristic method to solve combinatorial optimization problems, and efforts to quantify performance on real-world problems provide insights into how this approach may be best used in practice. We investigate the empirical performance of quantum annealing to solve the Nurse Scheduling Problem (NSP) with hard constraints using the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealing device. NSP seeks the optimal assignment for a set of nurses to shifts under an accompanying set of constraints on schedule and personnel. After reducing NSP to a novel Ising-type Hamiltonian, we evaluate the solution quality obtained from the D-Wave 2000Q against the constraint requirements as well as the diversity of solutions. For the test problems explored here, our results indicate that quantum annealing recovers satisfying solutions for NSP and suggests the heuristic method is potentially achievable for practical use. Moreover, we observe that solution quality can be greatly improved through the use of reverse annealing, in which it is possible to refine returned results by using the annealing process a second time. We compare the performance of NSP using both forward and reverse annealing methods and describe how this approach might be used in practice.","2019","5/4/2022 10:49","5/16/2022 16:18",null,"12837",null,"1","9",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.555555556,0.733333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",1.341,null,"Human health and social work activities","Human health activities","Hospital activities","Hospital activities"],["MXVUMVPM","conferencePaper",2021,"Henderson, Jessie M.; O\u2019Malley, Daniel; Viswanathan, Hari S.","Interrogating the performance of quantum annealing for the solution of steady-state subsurface flow",null,null,"2021 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)",null,null,"10.1109/HPEC49654.2021.9622819",null,"Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Conference","E","36","360","3600","In the 1990s, the principles of quantum mechanics were leveraged to describe how discrete combinatorial optimization problems could be solved using a method called quantum annealing.

In this paper we propose to leverage their capabilities to address an important task for recommender systems providers, the optimal selection of recommendation carousels. In many video-on-demand and music streaming services the user is provided with a homepage containing several recommendation lists, i.e., carousels, each built with a certain criteria (e.g., artist, mood, Action movies etc.). Choosing which set of carousels to display is a difficult problem because it needs to account for how the different recommendation lists interact, e.g., avoiding duplicate recommendations, and how they help the user explore the catalogue. We focus in particular on the adiabatic computing paradigm and use the D-Wave quantum annealer, which is able to solve NP-hard optimization problems, can be programmed by classical operations research tools and is freely available on the cloud. We propose a formulation of the carousel selection problem for black box recommenders, that can be solved effectively on a quantum annealer and has the advantage of being simple.

However the resulting spin configurations are not always in the ground state. It can rather quickly generate many spin configurations following the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution. In the present study, we formulate an Ising model to control a large number of automated guided vehicles in a factory without collision. We deal with an actual factory in Japan, in which vehicles run, and assess efficiency of our formulation.

Among others, an important goal is the minimization of the total transit time of the passengers. The corresponding objective function is quadratic in the binary decision variables encoding the flight-to-gate assignment. Hence, it is a quadratic assignment problem being hard to solve in general. In this work we investigate the solvability of this problem with a D-Wave quantum annealer. These machines are optimizers for quadratic unconstrained optimization problems (QUBO). Therefore the flight gate assignment problem seems to be well suited for these machines. We use real world data from a mid-sized German airport as well as simulation based data to extract typical instances small enough to be amenable to the D-Wave machine. In order to mitigate precision problems, we employ bin packing on the passenger numbers to reduce the precision requirements of the extracted instances. We find that, for the instances we investigated, the bin packing has little effect on the solution quality. Hence, we were able to solve small problem instances extracted from real data with the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer.","2019","4/25/2022 14:01","5/13/2022 22:04",null,"99-110",null,null,null,null,null,null,"Lecture Notes in Computer Science",null,null,null,"Springer International Publishing","Cham","en",null,null,null,null,"Springer Link",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\2MYGAWJY\\Stollenwerk et al. - 2019 - Flight Gate Assignment with a Quantum Annealer.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball","Quantum annealing; Airport planning; Quadratic assignment problem; QUBO","Feld, Sebastian; Linnhoff-Popien, Claudia",null,"NO",null,"YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES",null,"NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.571428571,0.642857143,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Service activities incidental to air transportation"],["VC9K5BV6","journalArticle",2020,"Stollenwerk, Tobias; O\u2019Gorman, Bryan; Venturelli, Davide; Mandr\u00e0, Salvatore; Rodionova, Olga; Ng, Hokkwan; Sridhar, Banavar; Rieffel, Eleanor Gilbert; Biswas, Rupak","Quantum Annealing Applied to De-Conflicting Optimal Trajectories for Air Traffic Management",18378.0,null,"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems",null,"1558-0016","10.1109/TITS.2019.2891235",null,"Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Journal","H","52","522","5223","We present the mapping of a class of simplified air traffic management problems (strategic conflict resolution) to quadratic unconstrained Boolean optimization problems.

The representation allows a natural decomposition of a real-world instance related to wind-optimal trajectories over the Atlantic Ocean into smaller subproblems that can be discretized and are amenable to be programmed in quantum annealers. In this paper, we tested the new programming techniques, and we benchmark the hardness of the instances using both classical solvers and the D-Wave 2X and D-Wave 2000Q quantum chip.

NSP seeks the optimal assignment for a set of nurses to shifts under an accompanying set of constraints on schedule and personnel. After reducing NSP to a novel Ising-type Hamiltonian, we evaluate the solution quality obtained from the D-Wave 2000Q against the constraint requirements as well as the diversity of solutions. For the test problems explored here, our results indicate that quantum annealing recovers satisfying solutions for NSP and suggests the heuristic method is potentially achievable for practical use. Moreover, we observe that solution quality can be greatly improved through the use of reverse annealing, in which it is possible to refine returned results by using the annealing process a second time. We compare the performance of NSP using both forward and reverse annealing methods and describe how this approach might be used in practice.","2019","5/4/2022 10:49","5/16/2022 16:18",null,"12837",null,"1","9",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.555555556,0.733333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",1.341,null,"Human health and social work activities","Human health activities","Hospital activities","Hospital activities"],["MXVUMVPM","conferencePaper",2021,"Henderson, Jessie M.; O\u2019Malley, Daniel; Viswanathan, Hari S.","Interrogating the performance of quantum annealing for the solution of steady-state subsurface flow",null,null,"2021 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)",null,null,"10.1109/HPEC49654.2021.9622819",null,"Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Conference","E","36","360","3600","In the 1990s, the principles of quantum mechanics were leveraged to describe how discrete combinatorial optimization problems could be solved using a method called quantum annealing.

This paper proposes a hybrid QC-based deep learning framework for fault diagnosis of electrical power systems that combine the feature extraction capabilities of conditional restricted Boltzmann machine with an efficient classification of deep networks. Computational challenges stemming from the complexities of such deep learning models are overcome by QC-based training methodologies that effectively leverage the complementary strengths of quantum assisted learning and classical training techniques. The proposed hybrid QC-based deep learning framework is tested on a simulated electrical power system with 30 buses and wide variations of substation and transmission line faults, to demonstrate the framework\u2019s applicability, efficiency, and generalization capabilities. High computational efficiency is enjoyed by the proposed hybrid approach in terms of computational effort required and quality of diagnosis performance over classical training methods. In addition, superior and reliable fault diagnosis performance with faster response time is achieved over state-of-the-art pattern recognition methods based on artificial neural networks (ANN) and decision trees (DT).","2021","5/11/2022 15:39","5/15/2022 17:13",null,"117628",null,null,"303",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\D8K5CDWH\\Ajagekar and You - 2021 - Quantum computing based hybrid deep learning for f.pdf",null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","NO","NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.555555556,0.8,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",3.062,null,"Manufacturing","Repair and installation of machinery and equipment","Repair of fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment","Repair of electrical equipment"],["I4392TBW","conferencePaper",2021,"Kuroda, T.; Kuwahara, T.; Yonaga, K.; Osaki, T.; Miyama, M.J.; Ohzeki, M.","Quantum annealing for ICT system design automation",null,695.0,null,null,null,"10.1109/CCGrid51090.2021.00025","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114897752&doi=10.1109%2fCCGrid51090.2021.00025&partnerID=40&md5=592ca6b65adab19df6e16a83ed8ee323","Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Conference","J","62","620","6202",null,"2021","5/11/2022 16:35","5/15/2022 15:32",null,"156-165",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Scopus",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"included",null,null,"Proceedings - 21st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing, CCGrid 2021","YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.555555556,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"A","Information and communication","Computer programming, consultancy and related activities","Computer programming, consultancy and related activities","Computer consultancy and computer facilities management activities"],["GHUSTHSC","bookSection",2020,"Chiscop, Irina; Nauta, Jelle; Veerman, Bert; Phillipson, Frank","A Hybrid Solution Method for the Multi-Service Location Set Covering Problem",null,952.0,"Computational Science \u2013 ICCS 2020",null,null,"10.1007/978-3-030-50433-5_41","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128623258","Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Conference","O","84","841","8413","Abstract The Multi-Service Location Set Covering Problem is an extension of the well-known Set Covering Problem. It arises in practical applications where a set of physical locations need to be equipped with services to satisfy demand within a certain area, while minimizing costs. In this paper we formulate the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, apply the hybrid framework of the D-Wave quantum annealer to solve it, and investigate the feasibility of this approach. To improve the often suboptimal initial solutions found on the D-Wave system, we develop a hybrid quantum/classical optimization algorithm that starts from the seed solution and iteratively creates small subproblems that are more efficiently solved on the D-Wave but often still converge to feasible and improved solutions of the original problem. Finally we suggest some opportunities for increasing the accuracy and performance of our algorithm.","2020","5/11/2022 15:39","5/16/2022 14:41",null,"531-545",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-50433-5_41",null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.666666667,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"A","Public administration and defence;

In this paper we propose to leverage their capabilities to address an important task for recommender systems providers, the optimal selection of recommendation carousels. In many video-on-demand and music streaming services the user is provided with a homepage containing several recommendation lists, i.e., carousels, each built with a certain criteria (e.g., artist, mood, Action movies etc.). Choosing which set of carousels to display is a difficult problem because it needs to account for how the different recommendation lists interact, e.g., avoiding duplicate recommendations, and how they help the user explore the catalogue. We focus in particular on the adiabatic computing paradigm and use the D-Wave quantum annealer, which is able to solve NP-hard optimization problems, can be programmed by classical operations research tools and is freely available on the cloud. We propose a formulation of the carousel selection problem for black box recommenders, that can be solved effectively on a quantum annealer and has the advantage of being simple.

Hardware implementations of quantum annealing, such as the quantum processing units (QPUs) produced by D-Wave Systems, have been subject to multiple analyses in research, with the aim of characterizing the technology\u2019s usefulness for optimization and sampling tasks. In this paper, we present a real-world application that uses quantum technologies. Specifically, we show how to map certain parts of a real-world traffic flow optimization problem to be suitable for quantum annealing. We show that time-critical optimization tasks, such as continuous redistribution of position data for cars in dense road networks, are suitable candidates for quantum computing. Due to the limited size and connectivity of current-generation D-Wave QPUs, we use a hybrid quantum and classical approach to solve the traffic flow problem.","2017","4/24/2022 18:26","5/13/2022 22:04","4/24/2022 18:26",null,null,null,"4",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Frontiers",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\CTK8HSJK\\Neukart et al. - 2017 - Traffic Flow Optimization Using a Quantum Annealer.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball",null,null,null,"YES","NO","YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.625,0.733333333,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Not assigned","Not assigned",null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Other transportation support activities"],["N4AXE29P","journalArticle",2019,"Ohzeki, Masayuki; Miki, Akira; Miyama, Masamichi J.; Terabe, Masayoshi","Control of Automated Guided Vehicles Without Collision by Quantum Annealer and Digital Devices",null,null,"Frontiers in Computer Science",null,"2624-9898","10.3389/fcomp.2019.00009","https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fcomp.2019.00009","Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Journal","H","52","522","5229","Recent advance on quantum devices realizes an artificial quantum spin system known as the D-Wave 2000Q, which implements the Ising model with tunable transverse field.

However the resulting spin configurations are not always in the ground state. It can rather quickly generate many spin configurations following the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution. In the present study, we formulate an Ising model to control a large number of automated guided vehicles in a factory without collision. We deal with an actual factory in Japan, in which vehicles run, and assess efficiency of our formulation.

In this work we investigate the solvability of this problem with a D-Wave quantum annealer. These machines are optimizers for quadratic unconstrained optimization problems (QUBO). Therefore the flight gate assignment problem seems to be well suited for these machines. We use real world data from a mid-sized German airport as well as simulation based data to extract typical instances small enough to be amenable to the D-Wave machine. In order to mitigate precision problems, we employ bin packing on the passenger numbers to reduce the precision requirements of the extracted instances. We find that, for the instances we investigated, the bin packing has little effect on the solution quality. Hence, we were able to solve small problem instances extracted from real data with the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer.","2019","4/25/2022 14:01","5/13/2022 22:04",null,"99-110",null,null,null,null,null,null,"Lecture Notes in Computer Science",null,null,null,"Springer International Publishing","Cham","en",null,null,null,null,"Springer Link",null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\2MYGAWJY\\Stollenwerk et al. - 2019 - Flight Gate Assignment with a Quantum Annealer.pdf",null,"included; forward snowball","Quantum annealing; Airport planning; Quadratic assignment problem; QUBO","Feld, Sebastian; Linnhoff-Popien, Claudia",null,"NO",null,"YES",null,null,"YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES",null,"NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.571428571,0.642857143,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,null,"Transportation and storage","Warehousing and support activities for transportation","Support activities for transportation","Service activities incidental to air transportation"],["VC9K5BV6","journalArticle",2020,"Stollenwerk, Tobias; O\u2019Gorman, Bryan; Venturelli, Davide; Mandr\u00e0, Salvatore; Rodionova, Olga; Ng, Hokkwan; Sridhar, Banavar; Rieffel, Eleanor Gilbert; Biswas, Rupak","Quantum Annealing Applied to De-Conflicting Optimal Trajectories for Air Traffic Management",18378.0,null,"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems",null,"1558-0016","10.1109/TITS.2019.2891235",null,"Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Journal","H","52","522","5223","We present the mapping of a class of simplified air traffic management problems (strategic conflict resolution) to quadratic unconstrained Boolean optimization problems.

NSP seeks the optimal assignment for a set of nurses to shifts under an accompanying set of constraints on schedule and personnel. After reducing NSP to a novel Ising-type Hamiltonian, we evaluate the solution quality obtained from the D-Wave 2000Q against the constraint requirements as well as the diversity of solutions. For the test problems explored here, our results indicate that quantum annealing recovers satisfying solutions for NSP and suggests the heuristic method is potentially achievable for practical use. Moreover, we observe that solution quality can be greatly improved through the use of reverse annealing, in which it is possible to refine returned results by using the annealing process a second time.

This paper proposes a hybrid QC-based deep learning framework for fault diagnosis of electrical power systems that combine the feature extraction capabilities of conditional restricted Boltzmann machine with an efficient classification of deep networks. Computational challenges stemming from the complexities of such deep learning models are overcome by QC-based training methodologies that effectively leverage the complementary strengths of quantum assisted learning and classical training techniques. The proposed hybrid QC-based deep learning framework is tested on a simulated electrical power system with 30 buses and wide variations of substation and transmission line faults, to demonstrate the framework\u2019s applicability, efficiency, and generalization capabilities. High computational efficiency is enjoyed by the proposed hybrid approach in terms of computational effort required and quality of diagnosis performance over classical training methods. In addition, superior and reliable fault diagnosis performance with faster response time is achieved over state-of-the-art pattern recognition methods based on artificial neural networks (ANN) and decision trees (DT).","2021","5/11/2022 15:39","5/15/2022 17:13",null,"117628",null,null,"303",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"C:\\Users\\cfpgo\\Zotero\\storage\\D8K5CDWH\\Ajagekar and You - 2021 - Quantum computing based hybrid deep learning for f.pdf",null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","NO","NO","YES",null,"YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.555555556,0.8,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,"Q1",3.062,null,"Manufacturing","Repair and installation of machinery and equipment","Repair of fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment","Repair of electrical equipment"],["I4392TBW","conferencePaper",2021,"Kuroda, T.; Kuwahara, T.; Yonaga, K.; Osaki, T.; Miyama, M.J.; Ohzeki, M.","Quantum annealing for ICT system design automation",null,695.0,null,null,null,"10.1109/CCGrid51090.2021.00025","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114897752&doi=10.1109%2fCCGrid51090.2021.00025&partnerID=40&md5=592ca6b65adab19df6e16a83ed8ee323","Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Conference","J","62","620","6202",null,"2021","5/11/2022 16:35","5/15/2022 15:32",null,"156-165",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Scopus",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"included",null,null,"Proceedings - 21st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing, CCGrid 2021","YES","YES","NO","YES",null,"NO","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"YES",0.555555556,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"A","Information and communication","Computer programming, consultancy and related activities","Computer programming, consultancy and related activities","Computer consultancy and computer facilities management activities"],["GHUSTHSC","bookSection",2020,"Chiscop, Irina; Nauta, Jelle; Veerman, Bert; Phillipson, Frank","A Hybrid Solution Method for the Multi-Service Location Set Covering Problem",null,952.0,"Computational Science \u2013 ICCS 2020",null,null,"10.1007/978-3-030-50433-5_41","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128623258","Hybrid","Quantum","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","Real Quantum Computer","Annealer","Conference","O","84","841","8413","Abstract The Multi-Service Location Set Covering Problem is an extension of the well-known Set Covering Problem. It arises in practical applications where a set of physical locations need to be equipped with services to satisfy demand within a certain area, while minimizing costs. In this paper we formulate the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, apply the hybrid framework of the D-Wave quantum annealer to solve it, and investigate the feasibility of this approach. To improve the often suboptimal initial solutions found on the D-Wave system, we develop a hybrid quantum/classical optimization algorithm that starts from the seed solution and iteratively creates small subproblems that are more efficiently solved on the D-Wave but often still converge to feasible and improved solutions of the original problem. Finally we suggest some opportunities for increasing the accuracy and performance of our algorithm.","2020","5/11/2022 15:39","5/16/2022 14:41",null,"531-545",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-50433-5_41",null,null,null,"included",null,null,null,"YES","YES","NO","YES","YES",null,"YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO","NO","YES","YES","NO","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","NO",null,"NO",0.666666667,0.666666667,"OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK",null,null,null,null,"A","Public administration and defence;
